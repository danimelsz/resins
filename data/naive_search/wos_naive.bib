Abstract = {{Objective The mango tree Mangifera indica is known as one of the
   botanical sources of propolis in Tropical regions. There are two
   different materials which bees can collect from a mango tree to produce
   propolis: the resin of the tree bark, and the latex found on the fruits.
   We performed the study of the chemical profile of mango resin in
   comparison with propolis in order to clarify its importance as propolis
   source. Results We compared the chemical profiles (by GC-MS analysis of
   ethanol extracts after silylation) of the resin and samples of propolis:
   of stingless bees (3 Vietnames, 2 Indonesian), and one of Apis mellifera
   from Thailand. In the resin and all propolis samples, 25 compounds were
   identified: fatty acids, cardanols (alk(en)yl phenols), cardols,
   anacardic acids, triterpene alcohols and ketones, cycloartane type
   triterpenic acids. All samples have the same qualitative composition but
   there are important quantitative differences. Considering literature
   data on mango latex, we conclude that bees of different species, make
   use of the two propolis sources offered by mango: bark resin and fruit
   latex, in different proportions. We also confirmed for the first time
   the presence of alk(en)yl phenols and anacardic acids in the tree bark
   resin of mango.}},

Title = {{Mitigating Nosema ceranae infection in western honey bee (Apis

Abstract = {{Beekeepers need sustainable control options to treat Nosema ceranae
   infection in colonies of western honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) they
   manage. Propolis is a natural product derived from plant resins and
   contains chemical compounds with potential antimicrobial activity
   against N. ceranae. Here, we determined the efficacy of propolis from A.
   mellifera (USA) and Tetrigona apicalis (stingless bees, Thailand)
   colonies as treatments for N. ceranae infection in honey bee workers.
   Newly emerged bees were individually fed 2 mu L of 50\% (w/v) sucrose
   solution containing 1 x 10(5) N. ceranae spores. Following this, the
   infected bees were treated with 50\% propolis extracted from A.
   mellifera or T. apicalis hives and fed in 50\% sucrose solution (v/v).
   All bees were maintained at 34 +/- 2 degrees C and 55 +/- 5\% RH. Dead
   bees were counted daily for 30 d to calculate survival. We also
   determined infection rate (\# infected bees/100 bees), infectivity
   (number of spores per bee) and protein content in the hypopharyngeal
   glands and hemolymph on 7, 14, and 21 d post infection as measures of
   bee health. Propolis from both bee species significantly reduced bee
   mortality, infection rate and infectivity compared with those of
   untreated bees and led to significantly greater protein contents in
   hypopharyngeal glands and hemolymph in treated bees than in untreated
   ones (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, propolis from A. mellifera and T.
   apicalis colonies shows promise as a control against N. ceranae
   infection in honey bees.}},

Title = {{Stingless Bee Propolis: New Insights for Anticancer Drugs}},
Journal = {{OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Natural products are important sources of biomolecules possessing
   antitumor activity and can be used as anticancer drug prototypes. The
   rich biodiversity of tropical and subtropical regions of the world
   provides considerable bioprospecting potential, including the potential
   of propolis produced by stingless bee species. Investigations of the
   potential of these products are extremely important, not only for
   providing a scientific basis for their use as adjuvants for existing
   drug therapies but also as a source of new and potent anticancer drugs.
   In this context, this article organizes the main studies describing the
   anticancer potential of propolis from different species of stingless
   bees with an emphasis on the chemical compounds, mechanisms of action,
   and cell death profiles. These mechanisms include apoptotic events;
   modulation of BAX, BAD, BCL2-L1 (BCL-2 like 1), and BCL-2;
   depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane; increased caspase-3
   activity; poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage; and cell death
   induction by necroptosis via receptor interacting protein kinase 1
   (RIPK1) activation. Additionally, the correlation between compounds with
   antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential is demonstrated that help in
   the prevention of cancer development. In summary, we highlight the
   important antitumor potential of propolis from stingless bees, but
   further preclinical and clinical trials are needed to explore the
   selectivity, efficacy, and safety of propolis.}},

Title = {{Stingless bee honey: An overview of health benefits and main market
   challenges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{This review aimed to evaluate the nutraceutical and medicinal effects of
   stingless bee honey (SBH) by bringing a discussion focused on the main
   known in vitro/in vivo health-promoting effects. SBH has a high-water
   content, slight sweetness, acidic flavor, fluid texture, and slow
   crystallization. The type and concentration of phenolic compounds and
   consequent antioxidant activity were mainly associated with the floral
   sources, geographical location, bee species, and processing steps. SBH
   has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial (against spoilage and pathogenic
   microorganisms), anti-diabetic, and skin aging delay activities in in
   vitro tests. It has also shown antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects,
   can protect from injuries caused by dyslipidemia, possess
   anti-inflammatory activity against chronic subclinical systemic
   inflammation and anti-diabetic properties, and can control and prevent
   Staphylococcus aureus infection on infected wound healings in in vivo
   tests (rats). However, clinical trials are crucial for the probation of
   the medicinal and nutraceutical properties of SBH. Despite this, there
   are still no general norms and/or quality standards for this type of
   honey. The information summarized in this review is important to add
   value to this little-consumed food, providing helpful information to
   spread knowledge about its benefits, assisting future studies, and
   raising perspectives for its recognition as a functional food.
   Furthermore, it may encourage the creation of standard quality for the
   production and marketing of SBH. Practical applications Previous studies
   have already summarized the chemical profile and physicochemical
   properties of stingless bee honey (SBH) and its potential health
   properties. However, no study has performed an overview of the potential
   nutraceutical and medicinal effects of SBH, presenting results from in
   vitro and in vivo investigations. Therefore, this review is the first
   study to overview the potential nutraceutical and medicinal effects of
   SBH, showing results of in vitro/in vivo health-promoting effects. The
   bioactivity of SBH is related to bee species and floral sources. The SBH
   has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant in
   vitro activity. It has also shown hypolipidemic effects and protection
   from injuries caused by dyslipidemia in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Heterotrigona itama is a stingless bee species from Meliponini tribe.
   The bee collects nectar, pollen and resin to produce honey, bee bread,
   and propolis. The bee is also known to visit and collect nectar from
   various types of flowers but there are limited studies on why this
   species of bee prefers to visit certain types of flowers. This study was
   conducted to identify the nectar concentration in selected flowers
   favoured by H. itama and the relationship between the bee and the
   morphology of the flowers. Nectar was obtained from different species of
   flowers and the concentrations were measured using a digital
   refractometer. The tube length of each flower species and the tongue
   length of the bees were also measured. The results revealed that flowers
   preferred by H. itama have high nectar concentrations. The tube lengths
   of the preferred flowers were between 2.0 and 4.0 mm, which is
   compatible with the tongue length of the bee. This study revealed that
   both nectar concentration and flower morphology are important factors
   for the bees in choosing their food sources. The results from this study
   will benefit the beekeepers in the identification of flowers that should
   be planted in their farms to improve stingless bee beekeeping
   activities. Understanding the relationship between the bees and their
   flower preferences could also help us to understand the importance of
   conserving both the bee colonies and the various species of flowering
   plants to ensure the sustainability of flora and fauna in the ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Propolis of stingless bees: A phytochemist's guide through the jungle of
   tropical biodiversity}},
Journal = {{PHYTOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Stingless bees (Meliponini), like honeybees Apis mellifera,
   collect plant resins in order to produce propolis (cerumen,
   geopropolis). This type of propolis has long been used in traditional
   medicine in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, India, and Vietnam, as a remedy
   for improving health and treating various diseases. The scientific and
   commercial interest in stingless bee propolis has been steadily
   increasing over the last few years. The new and growing knowledge in
   this field requires systematising, as a basis for further work. Recent
   reviews of Meliponini propolis deal only with the South American and
   Mesoamerican species, while reviews of the Asian, Australian and African
   species are missing. Furthermore, the chemical composition has not been
   thoroughly reviewed since 2007.
   Purpose: This review summarises and discusses the available data about
   the chemical composition of propolis from the stingless bee species
   (Meliponinae) of the Americas, Asia and Australia, published after 2007.
   The published information on the biological action of chemically
   characterised Meliponini propolis, and of individual constituents, is
   addressed. The plant sources of this propolis are also considered.
   Conclusion and perspectives: Chemical studies of Meliponini propolis has
   resulted in the discovery of new natural molecules, some of them with
   valuable bioactivity. Moreover, finding known molecules in propolis
   stimulates the study of their pharmacological properties. The enormous
   chemical variability of stingless bee propolis is a challenge to
   chemists, entomologists and pharmacologists. It is essential to perform
   pharmacological studies with only chemically characterised propolis of
   stingless bees. Further studies are required to chemically characterise
   and scientifically support the medicinal properties of stingless bee
   propolis and to clarify the potential for its commercial use. This could
   lead to increased prices for Meliponinae propolis and provide an
   additional source of income for farmers in rural communities with most
   serious social needs.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the foraging behaviour of Heterotrigona
   itama in exploiting food resources at a residential area, and the
   viability of this species to adapt to urban microclimatic conditions.
   Heterotrigona itama prefers to forage at areas closer to their nesting
   site, where diverse food sources are found. The marked bees of H. itama
   prefer to forage on various resources available at a 500-metre radius
   from the house yard. The obtained results indicate that the active
   foraging pattern of H. itama is negatively correlated to the time phases
   of a day (p < 0.05). This phenomenon was contributed by the three peaks
   of foraging hours, which reached a peak in the early morning (6:30 to
   8:00 a.m.), moderately peaked towards the evening (2:30 to 3:30 p.m.),
   and was greatest towards the afternoon (10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.). The
   ambient temperature and relative humidity were not the primary factors
   influencing the average number of foragers exiting from and returning to
   the hives (temperature, p > 0.05; and humidity, p > 0.05). There was a
   difference between the varieties of content resources collected by the
   bees (p < 0.05). The nectar or water sources was the highest material
   (51.39\%) that was brought back to the hive by foragers, followed by
   resin (34.73\%) and pollen (13.87\%). There was a significant difference
   in foraging time phases by returning foragers for collecting resin (p <
   0.05) and nectar or water ( p < 0.02), but there was no significant
   difference in foraging time phases found for pollen (p > 0.05). The
   results showed that H. itama is able to withstand urban microclimate
   conditions, and successfully incorporated pollen, nectar or water, and
   resin obtained from floral and non-floral resources into their diet.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a resinous mixture with a complex chemical composition,
   produced by honeybees and stingless bees from a variety of vegetal
   sources. In the last decades, propolis was extensively researched,
   multiple studies confirming its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,

   exponential increase in the number of patients with metabolic diseases,
   there is also a growing interest in the study of antidiabetic,

   this review was to evaluate the potential role of propolis in the
   prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus,
   dyslipidemia, and obesity. The preclinical in vivo and in vitro
   pharmacological models investigating antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic,
   and anti-obesity effects of propolis were reviewed with a focus on the
   putative mechanisms of actions of several chemical constituents.
   Additionally, the available clinical studies and an evaluation of the
   safety profile of propolis were also presented.}},

Title = {{Chemical composition, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial activity of
   propolis from Africanized honeybees and three different Meliponini
   species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{269}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Propolis extracts are widely used in
   traditional folk medicine and exhibit several properties such as
   antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial. However, these products
   have not been investigated in combination with medicines used in
   clinical practice.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition
   of propolis extracts from Apis mellifera scutellata and different
   Meliponini species and characterize their cytotoxicity against tumor
   cells, antibacterial effects, and interference with the actions of
   doxorubicin and gentamicin.
   Materials and methods: Chromatographic and spectrometric analyses were
   performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography
   (UPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Propolis extracts were
   evaluated for cytotoxicity and synergism using the
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
   and the antimicrobial activity was examined using the broth
   microdilution technique and synergism was investigated using
   checkerboard and time-kill assays.
   Results: The chemical characterization revealed the presence of 63
   compounds, and the extracts showed selective cytotoxicity against tumor
   cell lines. Propolis extracts of mandacaia and mirim exerted selective
   synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with doxorubicin. Except for the
   tubuna extract, all evaluated extracts exhibited antibacterial effects
   on gram-positive strains. Mandacaia and mirim extracts exerted a
   synergistic effect with gentamicin; however, only mandacaia extract
   exerted a selective effect.
   Conclusion: Propolis could be a source of antineoplastics and
   antibiotics. These natural products may reduce the occurrence of
   doxorubicin and gentamicin related adverse effects, resistance, or both.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a resinous material collected by bees from various plant
   sources. Propolis has been used since ancient times for medicinal
   purposes. In this study, the propolis extracts were dried using a
   freeze-drying technique to preserve its medicinal properties. The effect
   of different freezing temperatures on the yield and propolis powder flow
   ability characteristics was evaluated. The potential of propolis powder
   to be encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules and hard hydroxypropyl
   methylcellulose (HPMC) capsules were investigated. The mass uniformity,
   in vitro disintegration and dissolution performance of the propolis
   powder in hard gelatine capsules and hard HPMC capsules were determined
   after encapsulation. The amount of propolis powder produced after
   freeze-drying decreased with decreasing of freezing temperature from -50
   degrees C to -80 degrees C. Propolis powder obtained at -80 degrees C of
   freezing temperature showed excellent flow ability characteristics. The
   average mass of propolis powder in hard gelatine capsules and the
   propolis powder in hard HPMC capsules was 0.5578 +/- 0.019g and 0.5559
   +/- 0.020 g, respectively. In vitro disintegration test showed that the
   propolis powder that was loaded into the hard gelatine capsules
   disintegrated faster than the propolis powder loaded into the hard HPMC
   capsules, which were 1.7 to 7.8 min and 3.7 to 8.4 min in all four media
   solutions. Among the dissolution media tested, 1 \% SLS in water showed
   the highest release of flavonoid. The studies of an encapsulated form of
   propolis powder are recommended prior to the release of a dietary
   supplement or clinical trial investigational product to ensure its
   efficacy.}},

Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nutraceuticals from natural sources have shown potential new leads in
   functional food products. Despite a broad range of health-promoting
   effects, these compounds are easily oxidized and unstable, making their
   utilization as nutraceutical ingredients limited. In this study, the
   encapsulated stingless bees' propolis in liposome was prepared using soy
   phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol by thin-film hydration technique.
   Three different formulations of phosphatidylcholine composition and
   cholesterol prepared by weight ratio was conducted to extract high
   propolis encapsulation. Physicochemical changes in the result of the
   encapsulation process are briefly discussed using scanning electron
   microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. A dynamic
   light-scattering instrument was used to measure the hydrodynamic
   diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. The increment of the
   liposomal size was observed when the concentration of extract loaded
   increased. In comparing three formulations, F2 (8:1 w/w) presented the
   best formulation as it yielded small nanoparticles of 275.9 nm with high
   encapsulation efficiency (66.9\%). F1 (6:1 w/w) formed large particles
   of liposomes with 422.8 nm, while F3 (10:1 w/w) showed low encapsulation
   efficiency with (by) 38.7\%. The liposome encapsulation will provide an
   effective nanocarrier system to protect and deliver the flavonoids
   extracted from stingless bees' propolis.}},

   compounds (3-23) were isolated from propolis of the stingless bee
   Lisotrigona furva. Their chemical structures were determined by means of
   spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR, and MS. The chemical
   constituents are predominantly geranyl(oxy) xanthones and Cratoxylum
   cochinchinense was suggested as a resin source, besides two other plants
   Mangifera indica and dammar trees (Dipterocarpaceae). Compound 1 showed
   significant cytotoxic activity against KB, HepG-2, and Lu-1 cancer cell
   lines with IC50 values range from 12.63 to 15.17 mu g/mL. Several
   isolated compounds were active against one to four tested cancer cell
   lines. In addition, among the isolated compounds, alpha-mangostin (15)
   displayed the strongest antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+)
   strains, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans with MIC values ranging between
   1 and 2 mu g/mL. Compound 22 showed good activity against three Gram (+)
   strains and C. albicans.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are responsible for pollinating up to 90\% of Brazilian
   flora, so their study is of commercial and ecological importance.
   Stingless bees mix plant resins with wax and soil, forming geopropolis.
   Studies of the variability in composition and activity due to species,
   place and season of collection are lacking. Yield, total phenolic and
   flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity (via DPPH) of the extracts
   of fifteen M. quadrifasciata (Mandacaia) geopropolis samples collected
   over a year in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, as well as two samples
   from different regions of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil were
   compared. Composition was determined by ultra-high-resolution liquid
   chromatography and mass spectrometry, identifying 16 compounds. The
   month and region of collection affected the available plant resins and
   influenced their yield, composition and antioxidant capacity. Depending
   on the place of collection, M. quadrifasciata geopropolis is a promising
   natural source of antioxidant phenolic compounds.}},

Title = {{Brazilian peppertree, eucalyptus, and velame honeys: does palynology

Journal = {{ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{We investigated ten honey samples from the Discovery Coast of Bahia,
   Brazil, to confirm the three predominant flower sources indicated by
   regional beekeepers: Brazilian peppertree - Schinus terebinthifolia
   Raddi; eucalyptus - Eucalyptus L'Her. spp.; and velame - Croton L. spp..
   The honeys were collected in five Southern Bahia municipalities -
   Belmonte, Eunapolis, Guaratinga, Itabela and Porto Seguro. The samples
   underwent acetolysis and, after slides mounting, the pollen types were
   identified and counted to determine the frequency classes. The pollen
   spectra revealed 31 pollen types in 27 genera and 17 families. The
   palynological analysis confirmed the predominant eucalyptus flower
   source indicated for four honey samples from Belmonte, Eunapolis,
   Itabela and Porto Seguro. Three honey samples previously indicated with
   predominant eucalyptus and velame flower sources had no predominant
   pollen. Eucalyptus predominated as the main flower source for another
   three samples previously indicated by beekeepers as Brazilian peppertree
   and velame. We conclude that regional honeys marketed as having a
   predominant flower source may have distinct botanical origin. This
   demands further research aimed at reviewing which bee plants provide
   resources for monofloral, bifloral and plurifloral honeys in the Bahian
   Discovery Coast.}},

Journal = {{ANTIOXIDANTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bee products have been used since ancient times both for their
   nutritional value and for a broad spectrum of therapeutic purposes. They
   are deemed to be a potential source of natural antioxidants that can
   counteract the effects of oxidative stress underlying the pathogenesis
   of many diseases. In view of the growing interest in using bioactive
   substances from natural sources to promote health and reduce the risk of
   developing certain illnesses, this review aims to update the current
   state of knowledge on the antioxidant capacity of bee products such as
   honey, pollen, propolis, beeswax, royal jelly and bee venom, and on the
   analytical methods used. The complex, variable composition of these
   products and the multitude of analytical methods used to study their
   antioxidant activities are responsible for the wide range of results
   reported by a plethora of available studies. This suggests the need to
   establish standardized methods to more efficiently evaluate the
   intrinsic antioxidant characteristics of these products and make the
   data obtained more comparable.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to encapsulate anthocyanins and phenolic compounds
   extracted from a native Brazilian fruit peel - jabuticaba (Plinia
   cauliflora (Mart.) Kausel) and propolis from Tubuna (Scaptotrigona

   health. The alginate encapsulation was conducted by the ionotropic
   gelation through the dripping into the CaCl2 solution. Both raw extracts
   were characterized by TPC - total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu),
   AA-antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS assays), and TMAC - total
   monomeric anthocyanin concentration (pH differential method); as well as
   their resultant mixture (2:1 jabuticaba/propolis). The obtained beads
   presented highly efficient encapsulation of total polyphenols (similar
   to 98\%) and monomeric anthocyanins (similar to 89\%), with spherical
   morphology and smooth surface obtaining a mean diameter between 200 and
   250 mu m. In vitro release study showed that JPE/alginate beads were
   completely disintegrated at pH 7.4 (intestinal pH), but they were
   resistant to gastric pH (1.2) presenting a slow release of about 40\% in
   240min. This is the first report that encapsulates the mixture of
   jabuticaba and propolis extracts and may contribute to the utilization
   of a great source of bioactive compounds besides the potential pigment
   of anthocyanins, an alternative to natural and healthy food/beverage
   colorants. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Stingless bee is an insect that belongs to the family
   Apidae. Its name is based on its disability of stinging. It has a high
   product of Meliponini honey and propolis by which are commonly referred
   to as stingless bee honey and stingless bee propolis. Meliponini honey
   is one of the crucial natural sources and has the potential to kill
   infectious microorganisms. Previous studies have proved that the
   antibacterial activity of natural honey was an effect of hydrogen
   peroxide, a substance contained in the honey. However, these claims were
   contradicting with too many studies. Objective: Therefore, this study
   aimed to identify the antibacterial activity of Malaysian Meliponini
   honey which contained non-hydrogen peroxide against Staphylococcus
   aureus, an opportunistic microbial. Materials and Methods: Meliponini
   honey was used as an antibacterial agent for the treatment of S. aureus
   in agar well diffusion assay. An amplex red hydrogen peroxide kit was
   used to identify the hydrogen peroxide in the honey sample. Meanwhile,
   non-hydrogen peroxide activity was performed by using honey-catalase
   treated. Results: For the first time, we found that hydrogen peroxide
   was absent in all Meliponini honey samples. Meliponini honey has higher
   antibacterial activity (13.30 +/- 0.56 mm) compared to Apis honey (9.03
   +/- 0.22 mm) in agar well diffusion assay. Discussion: Non-hydrogen
   peroxide in Meliponini honey is a bioactive compound and beneficial to
   kill the microbial infection. Conclusion: Antibacterial activity of
   Malaysian Meliponini honey is directly contributed by non-hydrogen
   peroxide.}},

   heavy metals. Propolis of the different bee species could be
   distinguished based on their mineral compositions. The vibrational and
   absorption spectra suggested that propolis contains pi-conjugated
   aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as aromatic acids having amine,
   ester, carbonyl, alkyl, and hydroxyl functional groups which might be
   attributed to the presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. The
   antioxidant capacity of the propolis, based on radical scavenging
   activity of their ethanol extract, was in line with their total phenolic
   content. The ethanol extract of the propolis also showed antimicrobial
   activities against four bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis,
   Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
   The propolis showed slightly higher antibacterial activity against
   Gram-positive (B. subtilis and S. aureus) bacteria, indicating that the
   antimicrobial active compounds could be associated with flavonoids,
   which were quantified to be approximately comparable in all the
   propolis. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {{Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides is a species of stingless bee
   popularly known in Brazil as ``mandacaia{''}. Products derived from bees
   for food and therapeutic uses, have stimulated the evaluation of the
   chemical composition of geopropolis. Concentrations of 24 essential and
   potentially toxic elements were determined in geopropolis samples, using
   a sequential optical emission spectrometer with inductively coupled
   plasma (ICP OES) after microwave-assisted acid digestion. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were
   used to carry out an exploratory analysis of the samples. The following
   elements were quantified (in mg Kg(-1)): Al (320,414.40-36,911.1), As
   (<LoQ-4.37), Ba (38.36-211.11), Ca (672.38-94,527), Co (<LoQ-14.12), Cr
   (17.41-38.07), Cu (10.63-28.73), Fe (21,973.96-11,536.47), K
   (1974.38-9198.91), Mg (1961.17-7481.79), Mn (50.51-310.51), Na
   (154.55-340.46), Ni (2.28-21.74), P (16.59-51.07), Pb (3.45-8.55), Sb

   (28.77-78.73) and Zn (24.34-50.31). Cd and Mo were found to be below the
   limit of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) values of ICP OES in
   all investigated samples. Geopropolis can be a potential source of
   macro- and microelements for colonies and products derived from these
   bees for human consumption, contributing to their geographical origin
   and quality control, besides being an indicator of environmental
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptococcus neoformans, a life-threatening human yeastpathogen,has the
   ability to produce melanin, which is one of the common virulence factors
   contributing to cryptococcal pathogenesis. This virulence factor is
   closely associated with the cryptococcal cell wall, specifically chitin
   and chitosan polysaccharides, a complex structure that is essential for
   maintaining cellular structure and integrity. In this study, we aim to
   investigate the effects of two stingless bee (SLB) propolis
   fromTetragonula laevicepsandTetrigona melanoleucaagainst cell
   wall-associated melanin inC. neoformans,and its immune response in RAW
   264.7 macrophage. The ethanolic extract of SLB propolis (EEP) has
   strongly exhibited anti-cryptococcal activity. Moreover, EEP from both
   sources reduced chitin/chitosan and melanin production againstC.
   neoformansin a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, the mRNA expression
   level ofCDA1, IPC1-PKC1andLAC1genes involved in the cryptococcal
   melanization pathway was significantly decreased at 2 mg/mL in EEP
   treatment. Additionally, pretreatment with EEP prior to yeast infection
   dramatically reduced intracellular replication ofC. neoformansin RAW
   264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. This study might be a new
   insight to use a natural powerful source, not only acting to target cell
   wall-associated molecules, but also being capable to explore a novel
   strategy by which dysregulation of these molecules leads to promote
   immunomodulatory activity.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a bee product with various biological activities and

   chemical composition and botanical origin of Indonesian stingless bees
   propolis produced by Tetragonula laeviceps in Banten and Heterotrigona

   using 70\% ethanol and chloroform. The extracts were analysed by GC/MS
   after silylation. The results showed that the studied stingless bee
   propolis contained a relatively high amount of sugars, probably due to
   the harvesting method used. Furthermore, triterpenes were found as the
   main constituents followed by phenolic lipids. Both samples were
   Mangifera indica type propolis with typical compounds, including
   cycloartenol, isomangiferolic acid, mangiferolic acid, ambolic acid,
   alk(en)ylphenols, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and anacardic acids. Therefore,
   M. indica might be a preferred botanical source of propolis from a

Abstract = {{Nature is a vast source of medicinal substances, including propolis,
   which has been extensively investigated. Propolis is a resinous
   substance produced by bees from the exudates of plants that they collect
   and modify in their jaws; it is a rich and complex matrix with secondary
   metabolites of diverse botanical origins. The objective of this study
   was to apply an in vitro bioguided approach using as a model system the
   mollicutes with a sample of propolis from the Brazilian native bee
   Melipona quadrifasciata (mandacaia) in order to identify potential new
   molecules with antimicrobial activity. A crude hydroalcoholic extract
   was obtained and submitted to liquid-liquid partitioning with solvents
   of different polarities, generating four different fractions: aqueous,
   dichloromethane, butanol, and ethyl acetate fractions. The antimollicute
   activity assays served as a basis for the bioguided fractionation. The
   dichloromethane fraction was the most promising, exhibiting a minimal
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 125 mu g/mL against Mycoplasma
   pneumoniae. After purification by column liquid chromatography, a
   subfraction presenting MIC of 15.6 mu g/mL against Mycoplasma genitalium
   was highlighted. The fractions were also tested against Escherichia
   coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using gas
   chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS), several volatile
   compounds were identified in the non-polar fractions of this propolis.
   However, the more purified molecules had no better antimollicute
   activity than their original subfraction. Apparently, the synergism
   among its compounds is largely responsible for the antibacterial
   activity of the propolis of this native Brazilian bee.}},

Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},

Abstract = {{The dataset showed in this manuscript belongs to the investigation of
   the Southern-Brazilian geopropolis of stingless bees. Stingless bees are
   native species of insects from tropical areas; they produce honey,
   pollen and geopropolis that is composed of a mix of vegetal extracts,
   digestive enzymes, and mostly by soil. Used in folk medicine as
   antiseptic, antioxidant and antimicrobial agent, the composition is due
   to bee species, climate changes, local flora, and soil type. Moreover,
   the complex chemical content gives to the geopropolis a bioactive
   potential, with scavenging characteristics that is important to avoid
   free radical damages in the human health.
   Regarding the importance of exploring new natural matrices sources with
   bioactive potential, the first approach of chemical characterization of
   geopropolis is indispensable. Thus, ten samples of Southern-Brazilian
   geopropolis were analyzed and the bioactive responses obtained were
   discussed in the accompanying article titled ``Southern-Brazilian
   geopropolis: A potential source of polyphenolic compounds and assessment
   of mineral composition{''}. Furthermore, the physicochemical analysis of
   moisture and ash content, the yield of extraction, the reducing activity
   and free radical scavenging potential of ethanolic extracts, the
   antimicrobial activity, and the analysis of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS chromatograms
   are the main data presented in brief. The data can guide scientists in
   order to know methods and data for these samples. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Bees are of great importance for plant diversity for being an important
   pollinating agents. Stingless bees such as Scaptotrigona affinis
   postica, is cultivated largely due to the products offered by it. Pollen
   is one of these products, which has been highlighted for exhibit various
   therapeutic properties. Considering the bioactivity of this natural
   product, this study investigated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
   antinociceptive activities, and elucidated the chemical composition of
   pollen collected extract by Scaptotrigona affinis postica. Using in
   vitro assays, the antioxidant potential and inhibitory activity against
   the COX enzyme from pollen extract was evaluated. Additionally, tests
   were performed to measure the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive
   activities in animal models. In our results, we found that pollen
   extract showed antioxidant effects and inhibitory activity against the
   COX enzyme. The in vivo assays showed that the extract acts on the
   nervous system in local and systemic levels and that the
   anti-inflammatory activity is due the prostanoids reducing. Chemical
   analyses recognize 10 molecules in the extract belonging to the
   polyphenol and flavonoids classes and the computational study suggests
   that is responsible for the observed results. Thus, it is reported for
   the first time the biological potential of S. aff. postica pollen
   extract and we conclude that this bee product can be considered as one
   source of potential new drugs.}},

Abstract = {{The stingless bee Melipona mandacaia (Smith 1863) (mandacaia) is found
   only in the region of Caatinga, Northeastern Brazil, in the states of
   Bahia and Pernambuco, near to Sao Francisco river. The aim of the
   present work was to determine the botanical origin and to evaluate the
   phenolic content and antioxidant properties (beta-carotene/linoleic acid
   system, DPPH and ABTS scavenging) of mandacaia geopropolis. 25 pollen
   types from 15 families were identified from the 9 geopropolis samples
   analyzed. Phenolic compounds content varied between all the geopropolis
   EtOH extracts, hexane, EtOAc and MeOH:H2O fractions. The main pollens
   found in the geopropolis samples were from the Leguminoseae family. This
   identification of meliponicultural plants is extremely important because
   it indicates the food sources used for the collection of nectar and
   pollen. Our results revealed that there is a strong relation between the
   phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity. These results showed
   that total phenols of mandacaia geopropolis may be responsible for the
   antioxidant activity with evidence that it's a rich source of phenols
   bioactive compounds with potential health benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Eusocial bee foragers leave their nest with nectar as flight fuel,
   therewith reducing the risk of starvation during a foraging trip. Yet,
   the extra mass results in an increase of energetic expenditure for
   flight. Thus, bees should tune their fuel loads to the respective
   foraging situation. In the present study, we investigated the fuel
   adjustment in the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona subnitida (Apidae,
   Meliponini). Specifically, we examined whether foragers of this species
   increase their fuel loads when they have low expectation for nectar
   collection during a foraging trip. Crop load measurements revealed that
   nectar foragers carried significantly less fuel on departing the nest
   than foragers collecting either pollen, clay, or resin. Surprisingly,
   75\% of nectar foragers left the nest without any detectable amount of
   nectar, which suggests that the majority of bees collected at nearby
   nectar sources and avoided an increase in foraging costs. Moreover,
   foragers increased their fuel loading when repeatedly experiencing empty
   food sources that had previously been rewarding. These results support
   our hypothesis and demonstrate that the capability of fuel adjustment is
   not restricted to honey bees.}},

   Tetragonisca angustula were analyzed. Both reducing compounds with a
   maximum of 2.96\% GAE and free radical scavenging potential with a
   maximum of 5.84\% AAE and 8.58\% TE increases over 30 days of storage
   time. Also, methanolic extracts released at least 51\% more reducing
   compounds and exhibited at least 27\% more free radical scavenging
   potential in comparison to ethanolic extracts. The polyphenolic profile
   shows 31 compounds after add and alkaline hydrolysis as cinnamic acid,
   ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, aromadendrin, vanillin. For the mineral
   composition, sixteen minerals were found among essential and
   non-essential, differentiating each sample by chemometric PCA and HCA

Abstract = {{Bee bread samples of stingless bee (Heterotrigona itama) collected from
   Kelantan (east coast), Selangor (central) and Perak (northern) regions
   of Malaysia were subjected to nutritional analysis using standard
   hydrolysis and oxidation methods. Phytochemical screening was carried
   out on aqueous and ethanol extracts of bee bread. Total phenolic and
   flavonoid contents, free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing
   activity of the extracts were also assessed. All samples had essential
   and non-essential amino acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fat, flavonoids,
   tannins, phenols, xanthoproteins, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids,
   saponins, resins, and antioxidant activities. Sample from Kelantan had
   the significantly highest content of alanine, glycine and isoleucine,
   while sample from Selangor had the highest content of carbohydrate,
   total energy and proline. Sample from Perak had the highest content of
   fat. Bee bread ethanol extract demonstrated significantly higher
   antioxidant properties compared to bee bread aqueous extract with the
   highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents in sample from Perak and
   the highest free radical scavenging activity in sample from Selangor.
   Bee bread from Malaysia has good nutritional and antioxidant properties,
   which might indicate its potential to be a dietary supplement. The
   differences in compositions and antioxidant activities among the samples
   might be related to the floral sources and geographical locations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the physicochemical, antioxidant, antibacterial
   properties, and the toxicity of propolis particles produced by stingless
   bee Heterotrigona itama found in Brunei Darussalam were investigated.
   Propolis particles of different sizes were extracted from raw propolis
   using various volume fractions of ethanol in water. Spectroscopic
   analyses were utilized to characterize the chemical structures,
   functional groups, as well as absorbance and fluorescence properties.
   The total antioxidant capacity of propolis particles, which was assessed
   using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay, was found to increase
   with volume fraction of ethanol. The maximum antioxidant capacity was as
   high as 317.65 mg ascorbic acid equivalent per gram of propolis
   particles. All of the propolis particles showed antibacterial activity
   against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and
   Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coll. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
   The diameters of the inhibition zone were either significantly higher or
   equivalent to those of two standard antibiotics (rifampicin and
   streptomycin), suggesting strong antibacterial activity. The toxicity
   studies of propolis particles against Caenorhabditis elegans revealed
   that they are non-toxic after 24 h exposure. Overall findings suggest
   that H. itama propolis particles are not only an important source of
   natural antioxidants that could be beneficial for human health, but they
   have potentials as antimicrobial against bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria are present in stingless bee nest products. However, detailed
   information on their characteristics is scarce. Thus, this study aims to
   investigate the characteristics of bacterial species isolated from
   Malaysian stingless bee, Heterotrigona itama, nest products. Honey, bee
   bread and propolis were collected aseptically from four geographical
   localities of Malaysia. Total plate count (TPC), bacterial
   identification, phenotypic profile and enzymatic and antibacterial
   activities were studied. The results indicated that the number of TPC
   varies from one location to another. A total of 41 different bacterial
   isolates from the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria
   were identified. Bacillus species were the major bacteria found.
   Therein, Bacillus cereus was the most frequently isolated species
   followed by Bacillus aryabhattai, Bacillus oleronius, Bacillus
   stratosphericus, Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens,
   Bacillus nealsonii, Bacillus toyonensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus
   safensis, Bacillus pseudomycoides, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter
   cloacae, Pantoea dispersa and Streptomyces kunmingensis. Phenotypic
   profile of 15 bacterial isolates using GEN III MicroPlate (TM) system
   revealed most of the isolates as capable to utilise carbohydrates as
   well as amino acids and carboxylic acids and derivatives. Proteolytic,
   lipolytic and cellulolytic activities as determined by enzymatic assays
   were detected in Bacillus stratosphericus PD6, Bacillus
   amyloliquefaciens PD9, Bacillus subtilis BD3 and Bacillus safensis BD9.
   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PD9 showed broad-spectrum of antimicrobial
   activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. The
   multienzymes and antimicrobial activities exhibited by the bacterial
   isolates from H. itama nest products could provide potential sources of
   enzymes and antimicrobial compounds for biotechnological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are highly social pollinators in tropical ecosystems.
   Besides floral pollen and nectar, they collect substantial amounts of
   plant resins, which are used for nest construction/maintenance and
   defence against antagonists. Moreover, some stingless bees extract
   chemical compounds from resins and incorporate them in their cuticular
   chemical profiles, rendering this trait directly dependent on the plant
   community of the surrounding environment. While previous studies have
   investigated how variation in the composition and diversity of available
   resin sources affect resin storages inside hives, subsequent effects on
   the bees' cuticular chemistry have not been studied. To fill this gap,
   we investigatedthe number, proportion and composition of compounds in
   the cuticular chemical profile of an Australian stingless bee using gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry. We analysed whether and (if so)
   how the cuticular chemistry was affected by habitat (i.e., plantations,
   forests, and gardens) and tree species richness. We found that overall
   numbers and proportions of self-produced and resin-derived compounds in
   the cuticular chemical profiles of Tetragonula carbonaria were similar
   across habitats, while the composition of all compounds (i.e., both
   self-produced and resin-derived) and of resin-derived compounds differed
   between habitats. This indicates that the surrounding tree species
   community and thus available resin chemistry affected the composition of
   particularly resin-derived compounds on the bees' cuticle. As the number
   and composition of resin-derived cuticular compounds were not affected
   by tree species richness, stingless bees appear to selectively
   incorporate specific compounds available in the surrounding environment
   in their cuticular chemical profiles, which mayincrease their defensive
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a rich source of bioactive molecules made by bees by
   collecting an infinite variety of secondary metabolites from plants.
   This study determined the chromatographic and mass spectrometry profile
   along with the biological activity of propolis produced by the native
   Brazilian bee Melipona quadrifasciata. A hydroalcoholic crude extract
   was prepared and partitioned in solvents of different polarities,
   generating aqueous, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol and
   insoluble fractions. The phenolic and flavonoid content was also
   determined in crude aqueous and methanolic extracts as well. The
   antioxidant activity was determined by three different methods and
   correlated with the phenolic and flavonoid content. Extracts and
   fractions were tested against the herpes simplex virus type 1, and the
   cytotoxicity was evaluated in fibroblast L929 cells. The chromatographic
   and mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of catechin,
   epicatechin, aromadendrin, naringenin, pinocembrin and p-coumaric acid.
   The methanolic extract, ethyl acetate fraction and insoluble fraction
   possess higher phenolic and flavonoid content along with better
   antioxidant activities. The ethyl acetate and butanol fractions, along
   with the FM14 and FM45 subfractions demonstrated better viral
   inhibition, with 50\% inhibitory concentrations of 90.5, 294, 188 and
   58.5 mu g ml(-1), respectively. Among these, the ones presenting the
   best selectivity index were the ethyl acetate and FM45 fractions, with a
   pronounced virucidal effect. The methanolic extract stood out in the
   antioxidant activities and showed no cytotoxicity bellow 125 mu g
   ml(-1), exhibiting the most promising biological activity. Although this
   propolis seems to act in the early stages of herpetic infections, it is
   still difficult to correlate this activity with a single constituent of
   this complex mixture, suggesting a synergism in the extract components.
   To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with this propolis
   type. (C) 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Farmacognosia. Published by

Abstract = {{Stingless bee products such as honey, pollen, propolis, and geopropolis
   have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for the treatment
   of several illnesses. Investigation of the biological activity of
   stingless bee products, especially propolis and geopropolis, has
   revealed promising therapeutic properties. About 20\% of total
   Neotropical stingless bees can be found in Brazil. Despite the species
   diversity, studies on their biological activity are scarce. The present
   review focuses on the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of
   propolis and geopropolis from Brazilian stingless bees. In addition, the
   toxicity of these natural products was addressed. In order to provide
   new evidences for the toxic potential of propolis and geopropolis
   components, an in silico analysis was performed using the ADMET
   Predictor (TM) software. We observed that most of studies evaluated only
   crude ethanol extracts of a limited number of stingless bees species.
   Propolis and geopropolis displayed antioxidant capacity and
   antimicrobial activity. Concerning the toxic potential, the extracts of
   stingless bees propolis and geopropolis were considered safe.
   Nonetheless, in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies are still
   necessary. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda. on behalf of

   for the first time. Using different chromatographic procedures, a total
   of eighteen constituents (phenols and triterpenes) were isolated, among

   propolis. Propolis extract was also characterized by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry and other fifteen constituents were
   identified. The xanthone alpha-mangostin (8) demonstrated significant
   activity against Staphylococcus aureus with MIC and MBC 0.31 mu g/ml,
   followed by 7,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-8-methylflavane (1) with MIC 78 mu
   g/ml and MBC 156 mu g/ml. 10,11-Dihydroxydracaenone C (4), a component
   bearing orthohydroxyl groups, was the only compound displaying radical

Abstract = {{y This study clarifies the chemical constituents and botanical origin of
   Tetragonula sapiens Cockerell bee propolis collected from Southeast
   Sulawesi, Indonesia. Propolis samples and resin of Mangifera indica were
   extracted with 99\% ethanol to obtain an ethanol extract of propolis
   (EEP) and an ethanol extract of M. indica resin (EEM). Column
   chromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) were developed and used for the separation
   and isolation of compounds from the ether-soluble fraction. The
   structure of the compounds was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectroscopic analysis, and their molecular weight analyzed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The HPLC chromatogram of the
   EEP was then compared with the HPLC chromatogram of EEM to investigate
   the botanical origin of propolis. Five compounds were isolated from the
   EEP, and their structures were determined as mangiferolic acid,
   cycloartenol, ambonic acid, mangiferonic acid, and ambolic acid, which
   are cycloartane-type triterpenes. The characteristic peak of the HPLC
   chromatograms of EEP and EEM showed a similar pattern, which is that the
   main components of propolis were also found in M. indica resin. These
   results suggested that the propolis from Southeast Sulawesi was rich in
   cycloartane-type triterpenes, and the plant source of the propolis could
   be Mangifera indica (mango).}},

Abstract = {{Background: There has been increasing evidence showing that stingless
   bee honey exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
   properties. Pharmacologically-active components in honey such as
   flavonoids and phenolic constituents are known to contribute to its
   medicinal benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study on evaluating anticancer effects of locally-produced Malaysian
   stingless bee honey from Heterotrigona itama sp. on malignant glioma
   cells.
   Methods: Proliferation and apoptosis studies of U-87 MG cells following
   stingless bee honey treatment were carried out using MTS assay and
   acridine orange/propidium iodide dual staining, respectively.
   Results: Results demonstrated time and dose-dependent cytotoxicity using
   0.625\%, 1.25\% and 10\% stingless bee honey (P < 0.05). IC50 values
   were calculated using cells treated with 10\% stingless bee honey. It
   was also observed that 10\% stingless bee honey induced nuclear
   shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nucleus fragmentation, indicating
   that cellular changes were consistent with the apoptotic characteristics
   of the cells.
   Conclusion: These data provide a good basis for further evaluation of
   the medicinal properties of stingless bee honey from Heterotrigona itama
   sp. This source of honey may serve as a potential therapy for malignant
   glioma.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a sticky material manufactured by stingless bees to build
   and protect their hive. This material is known to be a rich source of
   biologically active constituents. Chemical composition that is attribute
   to its biological activities is highly dependent on plant sources and
   geographical origin. Chemical profiling was performed on Malaysian
   stingless bee (Heterotrigona itama) propolis samples collected from ten
   localities in two Malaysian states of Kelantan and Terengganu. High
   performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) was employed in chemical
   profiling. Antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC) and total
   flavonoid content (TFC) were also evaluated. Phytochemical profiling
   showed that all localities have different chemical composition in terms
   of number of bands and intensity of the bands, indicating the variation
   of chemical composition. Antioxidant activity varied significantly
   between the localities with sample of Besut, Terengganu (BST-1) possess
   the highest DPPH radical inhibition (88.86 mu g/mL) with IC50 of 11 mu
   g/mL. Likewise, all samples has varied total phenolic and total
   flavonoid content ranged from 15.89 - 115.98 mg GAE/g and 15.84 - 48.65
   mg QE/g, respectively. BST-1 has the highest content of both group of
   compounds. Findings from this study show that Malaysian stingless bee
   propolis has great chemical diversity and can potentially be the source
   for important biological activity including antioxidant agent. This
   study also revealed that geographical origin play a significant role in
   quality of propolis.}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a plant-derived substance collected by stingless bee's
   product from various sources, including plant resins with combination of
   bee's saliva and wax. Propolis has been used to treat several diseases
   since ancient times and it is an important source of bioactive natural
   compound and drug derivatives. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   biological and chemical profiles of ethanolic extracts from propolis
   produced by Heterotrigona itama (HI), Geniotrigona thoracica (GT),
   Lepidotrigona terminate (LT), and Tretrigona apicalis (TA). Cytotoxicity
   activity was evaluated by using
   3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay
   against three cancer cell lines. H. itama extracts showed the highest
   cytotoxicity effect with IC50 of 5 mu g/mL, 4 mu g/mL and 8 mu g/mL for
   MDA-MB-231, SK-UT-1 and HeLa, respectively. Other species only possessed
   moderate to weak cytotoxicity effect against tested cells. Phytochemical
   screening was carried out by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
   and visualized by derivatives agents in order to detect the presence of
   terpenoids, steroids, saponins, essential oils and phenol. It was found
   that H. itama (HI) possessed the highest antioxidant activity with the
   lowest IC50 of 30 mu g/mL with percetange of inhibition at 85.69 \%
   evaluated by (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) DPPH scaveging
   assay. In conclusion, bee species was considered as important factor in
   selecting the quality of propolis. It was found that H. itama produced
   the most active extract compared to other species. The data obtained
   from this study would be the basis for further investigation on
   therapeutic application especially for cytotoxic activity, antioxidant

   profile that varied from each other. The antioxidant properties of
   extracts were evaluated based on total phenolic content, total flavonoid
   content and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging
   activity. Propolis from Gua Musang (GM) exhibited the highest total
   phenolic content with 23.43 +/- 0.50 mg GAE/g extract while propolis
   from Besut (BST) exhibited the highest total flavonoids content with
   17.22 +/- 0.16 mg QE/g extract and showed the lowest IC50 with 53 mu
   g/mL for DPPH radical scavenging activities. As a result, Geniotrigona
   thoracica from Besut (BST) could be considered as a good source of
   antioxidant due to its antioxidant properties.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the pollen spectra from 130 geopropolis samples collected by
   Melipona subnitida, M. seminigra, M. flavolineata, and M. fasciculata.
   The samples were collected in the municipality of Santa Luzia do Parua
   in the Alto Turi region, part of the Amazon region in the state of
   Maranhao. The objective was to determine the phytogeographic pollen
   profile of geopropolis samples from Melipona, and to help characterize
   the resin supplying vegetation for these bees. Geopropolis samples were
   collected monthly from December 2013 to December 2014 from nests kept in
   wooden boxes in a private meliponary. Samples were prepared using
   standard methodology. A total of 148 pollen types were identified,
   distributed among 49 plant families and 108 genera. The months with the
   greatest richness of pollen types were December 2013, June 2014,
   September 2014, October 2014, and December 2014. The botanical family
   Fabaceae presented the greatest pollen richness (39 types), followed by
   Rubiaceae (11 types). The most common pollen types in the geopropolis of
   the four Melipona species were: Attalea speciosa, Anacardium, Borreria
   verticilatta, Baccharis, Clusia, Chamaecrista, Croton, Euterpe/Syagrus,
   Eucalyptus, Hyptis, Mauritia, Mimosa pudica, M. caesalpinaefolia,
   Mouriri, Myrcia/Psidium, Protium, and Symphonia globulifera,
   characteristic of the phytogeographic pollen profile of the product in
   the study region. The pollen types Anacardium, Ardisia, Baccharis,
   Caryocar, Clusia, Clusia grandiflora, Eucalyptus, Eupatorium, Hyptis,
   Myrcia/Psidium, Platonia insignis, Protium, Spondias, Symphonia
   globulifera, Tapirira, and Vismia were identified as possible sources of
   resin for Melipona geopropolis.}},

Abstract = {{Social insects construct nests that protect their brood and food
   resources from both the physical environment and natural enemies.
   Stingless bees use plant-derived resins, mixed with wax to form
   propolis, in the construction of their nests, and these products can be
   effective sources of defense against natural enemies, including ants.
   However, it is not known whether this defense, in the form of deterring
   or repelling workers, derives from the physical properties or chemical
   compounds of these products. The nest entrance of Tetragonula carbonaria
   is constructed with propolis and Corymbia resins, and we ask whether
   nonvolatile chemicals present in these products act as a defense against
   ants. Our field experiments revealed that workers of Iridomyrmex mayri
   Forel were deterred from crossing a chemical barrier comprising
   nonvolatile, nonpolar (hexane) extracts of propolis and Corymbia tree
   resin. However, polar (ethanol) extracts did not have this effect. These
   data are the first to demonstrate that the chemical components alone of
   entrance propolis and resins can provide a nest-defense function against
   ants.}},

   Particulate Material (SPM) in five points a Mineral Province, in Brazil.
   More than 50 elements were identified by ICP-OES and ICP-MS, after
   microwave digestion. Overall, we found a strong relation among elements
   present on pollen and SPM. Samples from the four areas exhibited higher
   levels of minerals compared to the reference site. Mineral levels varied
   widely within the two seasonal periods. Some elements, like Pb, Cd, As,
   Cu, Zn, and Fe were found at levels considered potentially toxic to
   human health. Pollen stored by stingless bees was a successful
   bioindicator, and demonstrated the value of quantitative ecological

Title = {{Melliferous insects and the uses assigned to their products in the
   northern Yungas of Salta, Argentina}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The order Hymenoptera comprises melliferous insects (bees,
   wasps and bumblebees); among them, stingless bees comprise a diverse
   group of eusocial insects present in tropical and subtropical areas. Of
   a total of approximately 500 species, 400 are found in the Neotropics.
   On the continent of America, before the introduction of Apis mellifera,
   these insects represented the main source of honey and wax. In
   Argentina, ethnobiological investigations had been carried out on this
   group of insects, principally in the Atlantic Forest and Chaco regions.
   Out of a total of 33 species, only 14 were recorded for use or breeding.
   In the Yungas, however, there are no ethnobiological studies analyzing
   this group of species, although the use of their products is mentioned
   in different ethnobotanical works. This paper studies the knowledge and
   uses of melliferous insects by the inhabitants of the village of Baritu
   and surrounding.
   Method: Information on location, management and duties assigned (e.g.,
   preparation and administration) to deal with bee products like honey,
   pollen, wax and propolis was obtained through semi-structured
   interviews. Besides, reference material was collected to identify
   melliferous insects known and used in the region.
   Results: Fifteen ethnospecies were identified and grouped locally
   according to their defensive behavior. The culturally most important
   species is the stingless bee Plebeia sp. nov.-mansita-, in terms of
   frequency of citations and diversity of uses, and among those that
   sting, the honeybee Apis mellifera-extranjera-. Honey, pollen, wax, and
   propolis of Plebeia sp. nov. had the highest current frequency of use.
   Honey is used in food (incorporated at pure state, as a complement and
   in drinks), as nutraceutical food and in medicinal preparations. In
   addition, it is an important resource for marketing during the warm
   season, infusions being the main mode of administration. Pollen is used
   as a supplement for food and alcoholic drinks, wax mainly in candle
   making, and propolis.
   Conclusion: The data obtained in this study complements the information
   available in ethnobotanical studies carried out in the region. The
   present study is the first on melliferous insects in the area. A new
   species of stingless bee the genus Plebeia was registered, and it was
   observed that the known distribution of others has increased.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Propolis is a natural product of plant resins collected by
   honeybees from various plant sources. It is used as a remedy in folk
   medicine since ancient times because of its several biological and
   pharmacological properties. Recently, propolis has been used by dentist
   to treat various oral diseases. It was always mentioned as an
   anti-inflammatory agent. Cytokines are proteins that provide
   communication between cells and play a critical role in a wide variety
   of processes. It released from cells in an inflammatory process that
   active, mediate or potential actions of other cells or tissues. When
   dental pulp has inflammation, several pro-inflammatory cytokines
   including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was released by innate immune
   cells.Objective: To analyse the expression of IL-6 on inflamed rat
   dental pulp tissue following application of propolis. Material and
   methods: Trigona sp. propolis was obtained from Luwu Regency, south
   Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Flavonoid and non-flavonoid extracts were
   purified from propolis using thin layer chromatography. The study was
   applied on 80 male Sprague Dawley rats, 1012 weeks of age, divided
   randomly and equally into 5 groups. Group I, as negative control group
   was not conducted any treatment. At group II, III, IV and V. A Class I
   cavity (Black Classification) were made on the occlusal surface of right
   maxillary first molar. The dental pulp was perforated using dental
   explorer and allowed in the oral environment for 1 h, after that,
   Ethanolic Extract Propolis (EEP) (Group II), Extract Flavonoid-Propolis
   (EFP) (Group III), Extract Non-Flavonoid Propolis (ENFP) (Group IV), or
   Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) (Group V) were applied on dental pulp. All
   cavities were then filled with Glass Ionomer Cement as permanent
   filling. The rats being sacrificed in 6 h, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days.
   Sample biopsy were obtained, IL-6 expression was detected by using
   immunohistochemistry method. Data was analyzed statistically using
   Freidman and Kruskal Wallis tests with significance level of P < 0.05.
   Results: All agent showed IL-6 expression in inflamed rat dental pulp
   tissue, and this expression was decreased with the longer of observation
   time periods. EEP more stronger to decreased IL-6 expression on inflamed
   rat dental pulp tissue than other agent. There is significant difference
   (P < 0.05) of IL-6 expression between group I and other groups in 6 h
   and 2 days but not in 4 and 7 days time periods.Conclusion: Trigona sp.
   propolis from south Sulawesi, Indonesia could suppressed the expression
   of IL-6 on inflamed rat dental pulp tissue. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {{Generalist social bees maximize diversity intake in plant species-rich
   and resource-abundant environments}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies revealed a positive relationship between biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning, suggesting that biodiverse environments may
   not only enhance ecosystem processes, but also benefit individual
   ecosystem members by, for example, providing a higher diversity of
   resources. Whether and how the number of available resources affects
   resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting
   functions associated with resources) have, however, been little
   investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may
   help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species
   typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a
   social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated
   how plant species richness-recorded for study sites located in different
   habitats-and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and
   functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial
   activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a
   generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin
   collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species
   richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with
   resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource
   diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse
   resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared
   to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in
   our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity
   intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts
   of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that
   the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available
   resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced
   resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality,
   particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific
   plant species) become scarce.}},

Title = {{Antioxidant Activity of a Geopropolis from Northeast Brazil: Chemical
   Characterization and Likely Botanical Origin}},
Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Geopropolis is a product containing wax, plant resin, and soil
   particles. It is elaborated by stingless bees of tribe Meliponini.
   Methanol extracts of sample of geopropolis produced by Scaptotrigona
   postica ({''}mandaguari{''}) in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN,
   northeast Brazil) were analyzed for the determination of standard
   parameters (total phenols, total flavonoids, and radical scavenging
   activity) and chemical characterization by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis. The
   sample analyzed has high contents of total phenols and flavonoids, as
   well as high antioxidant activity. The constituents characterized were
   mainly flavonols, such as quercetin methyl ethers, and methoxychalcones.
   Such chemical profile is similar to the composition of a green propolis
   from the same area of RN, which is produced by Africanized Apis
   mellifera, using shoot apices of Mimosa tenuiflora, popularly known as
   ``jurema-preta.{''} This finding provides evidence that ``mandaguari{''}
   geopropolis and honeybee propolis have the same botanical origin in RN.
   The sharing of a plant resin source by phylogenetically distant bees
   (Apinae andMeliponinae) suggests that bee genetic factors play little
   role in the choice of plants for resin collection and that the
   availability of potential botanical sources plays a decisive role.}},

Abstract = {{Since chemical or pharmacological studies on the propolis of Brazilian
   native bees are scarce, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
   chemical profile, the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antibacterial activity
   of aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts and isolated compounds of
   propolis of the native bees, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonisca
   angustula, against bacteria with (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and
   without cell wall (mollicutes). The extracts presented a peculiar
   feature between green and yellow propolis. Despite the low content of
   flavonoid and phenolic compounds, a promising level of antioxidant
   activity without toxicity in the propolis extracts of M. quadrifasciata
   was observed. The best antimicrobial activity was that of the
   hydro-alcoholic extract against Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Ureaplasma
   urealyticum (MIC 125 mu g/ml). We isolated two compounds and identified
   them from the aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts as the flavononol
   sakuranetin and gallic acid. Sakuranetin and gallic acid presented MICs
   of 50 and 25 mu g/ml against Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma
   genitalium respectively. Propolis from Brazilian native bees may
   constitute an alternative and undervalued source of compounds with
   biological activity. The mollicutes are the smallest self-replicating
   bacteria that constitute a model of cellular and molecular biology
   studies due to their small genome and restrict biochemical machinery.
   This is the first report investigating the potential of antibacterial
   molecules isolated from propolis of Brazilian native bees using this
   microorganism model. Our results contribute to a better understanding of
   the chemical and biological properties of these propolis types and
   provide evidence for its potential medicinal use.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of propolis depends on time, vegetation and the location
   of the collection area. The objective of this study was to determine the
   physicochemical characteristics, the concentration of phenol compounds
   and the antioxidant capacity of propolis of native stingless bees
   (Meliponinae) and Apis from the State of Tocantins. Extraction with 80\%
   ethanol (v/v) was performed in order to obtain the extracts. Parameters
   examined were: propolis mass loss by desiccation at 105 degrees C,
   ashes, wax concentration and pH. Furthermore, the propolis antioxidant
   activity was measured, as well as the total concentration of phenol
   compounds. The extracts were also analyzed by high performance liquid
   chromatography. The total concentration of phenol compounds varied
   between 121.78 and 631.29 (mg GAE g(-1)). The antioxidant activity
   expressed by the value of CE50 varied between 29.81 and 845.38 mu g
   mL(-1). High performance liquid chromatography analysis allowed us to
   infer the existence of phenol compounds. The results indicated that the
   studied propolis samples constitute good sources of natural
   antioxidants. The variety of phenol compounds identified in this study,
   and the diverse biological functions reported in literature for these
   compounds indicated that this stingless bee propolis (Meliponinae) and
   Apis has a high pharmacological potential.}},

   Bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Tree invasions have substantial impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning, and trees that are dispersed by animals are more likely to
   become invasive. In addition, hybridisation between plants is well
   documented as a source of new weeds, as hybrids gain new characteristics
   that allow them to become invasive. Corymbia torelliana is an invasive
   tree with an unusual animal dispersal mechanism: seed dispersal by
   stingless bees, that hybridizes readily with other species. We examined
   hybrids between C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora to
   determine whether hybrids have inherited the seed dispersal
   characteristics of C. torelliana that allow bee dispersal. Some hybrid
   fruits displayed the characteristic hollowness, resin production and
   resin chemistry associated with seed dispersal by bees. However, we did
   not observe bees foraging on any hybrid fruits until they had been
   damaged. We conclude that C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp.
   citriodora hybrids can inherit some fruit characters that are associated
   with dispersal by bees, but we did not find a hybrid with the complete
   set of characters that would enable bee dispersal. However, around
   20,000 hybrids have been planted in Australia, and ongoing monitoring is
   necessary to identify any hybrids that may become invasive.}},

Abstract = {{The health industry has always used natural products as a rich,
   promising, and alternative source of drugs that are used in the health
   system. Propolis, a natural resinous product known for centuries, is a
   complex product obtained by honey bees from substances collected from
   parts of different plants, buds, and exudates in different geographic
   areas. Propolis has been attracting scientific attention since it has
   many biological and pharmacological properties, which are related to its
   chemical composition. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been
   performed to characterize and understand the diverse bioactivities of
   propolis and its isolated compounds, as well as to evaluate and validate
   its potential. Yet, there is a lack of information concerning clinical
   effectiveness. The goal of this review is to discuss the potential of
   propolis for the development of new drugs by presenting published data
   concerning the chemical composition and the biological properties of
   this natural compound from different geographic origins.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees accumulate deposits of plant resins that are mixed with
   beeswax to produce propolis. Previous studies have reported
   anti-microbial constituents of stingless bee (Tetragonula carbonaria)
   propolis from East Australia, but several components remained to be
   characterized. In the search of natural products yet unreported for
   Australian propolis, four bee deposit-resins of T. carbonaria bees were
   analysed by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with
   accurate mass measurements. Ethanolic extracts of the deposit-resins
   were tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25983 and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the agar diffusion method.
   Phloroglucinols, flavonoids and isoprenoids were identified in samples.
   The crude extracts showed strong anti-staphylococcal effects but were
   less active against the Gram-negative bacterium. The diagnostic data
   enabled the identification of markers that can be used for profiling
   other Australian propolis sources and to target the isolation of
   bioactive phloroglucinols in future studies against antibiotic resistant
   S. aureus strains. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the loss of the sting apparatus, Meliponini (stingless) bees
   have not lost their ability to defend themselves. Several defensive
   strategies have been described for the group, including biting and resin
   deposition. Defensive behavior can be mediated by chemical
   communication, for example through the use of alarm pheromones. The
   Stingless bee species Melipona flavolineata Friese is an important
   species for meliponiculture in Brazil, especially in the Amazon region.
   In order to improve the current management methods for the species, this
   study aimed to describe the range of defensive strategies used by the
   stingless bee M. flavolineata towards inter and intraspecific chemical
   signals known to trigger defensive responses in related species, namely
   the head secretions of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao (Smith) and
   the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers.
   The stimuli provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions
   of the robber bee repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of
   the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and the agglomeration of
   workers outside the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract
   elicited aggression towards the pheromone deposition site, transport of
   resin and generalised agitated flights. Our results confirm the role of
   the mandibular gland as a source of alarm pheromone in this species and
   the chemical triggering of a specific defensive response to the known
   cleptoparasite L. limao.}},

Abstract = {{Like many stingless bee species, Melipona subnitida Ducke uses
   geopropolis (a mixture of wax, plant resins, pollen grains and mud) for
   sealing small crevices in their nest cavities, in order to avoid the
   entry of air, and for defense against pathogenic microorganisms. The aim
   of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive and free
   radical-scavenging activities of ethanolic extracts of six geopropolis
   samples from M. subnitida and the phenolic fractions obtained by C18-SPE
   extraction. The in vivo antinociceptive activity was analyzed on
   abdominal constriction induced by acetic acid in mice and in vitro free
   radical-scavenging activities by DPPH and ABTS assays. Additionally we
   analyzed the chemical composition of the phenolic fractions by HPLC-DAD.
   The six samples of geopropolis showed variations in the total phenolic
   content over the period, but not in the chemical profile observed by
   HPLC-DAD. Geopropolis is a rich source of bioactive compounds as
   phenolics 6-O-p-coumaroyl-D-galactopyranose,
   6-O-cinnamoyl-1-O-pcoumaroyl- -D-glucopyranose, 7-O-methyl naringenin,
   7-O-methyl aromadendrin, 7,4'-di-O-methyl aromadendrin, 4'-O-methyl
   kaempferol, 3-O-methyl quercetin, 5-O-methyl aromadendrin and 5-O-methyl
   kaempferol with potential antioxidant and antinociceptive activities.
   The antioxidant activity is related to the total phenolic content.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiverse environments provide a variety of resources that can be
   exploited by consumers. While many studies revealed a positive
   correlation between biodiversity and consumer biomass and richness, only
   few studies have investigated how resource diversity affects single
   consumers. To better understand whether a single consumer species
   benefits from diverse resources, we tested how the protective function
   of a defensive plant resource (i.e. resin exploited by social bees)
   varied among different sources and target organisms (predators,
   parasites and pathogens). To assess synergistic effects, resins from
   different plant genera were tested separately and in combination. We
   found that resin diversity is beneficial for bees, with its functional
   properties depending on the target organisms, type and composition of
   resin. Different resins showed different effects, and mixtures were more
   effective than some of the single resins (functional complementarity).
   We conclude that resins of different plant species target different
   organisms and act synergistically where combined. Bees that rely on
   resin for protection benefit more when they have access to diverse resin
   sources. Loss of biodiversity may in turn destabilize consumer
   populations due to restricted access to a variety of resources.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To evaluate antimicrobial effects of mixtures of Ethiopian
   honeys and ginger rhizome powder extracts on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC
   25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
   Escherichia coli (R), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (R). Methods. Agar
   diffusion and broth assays were performed to determine susceptibility of
   these standard and resistant clinical bacteria isolates using
   honey-ginger powder extract mixtures. Results. Honey-ginger powder
   extract mixtures produced the highest mean inhibition (25.62 mm +/-
   2.55) compared to the use of honeys (21.63 mm +/- 3.30) or ginger
   extracts (19.23 mm +/- 3.42) individually. The ranges of inhibitions
   produced by honey-ginger extract mixtures on susceptible test organisms
   (26-30 mm) and resistant strains (range: 19-27 mm) were higher compared
   to 7-22 mm and 0-14 mm by standard antibiotic discs. Minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MIC) of mixture of honeys-ginger extracts were 6.25\%
   (0.625 v/mL) on the susceptible bacteria compared to 75\% for resistant
   clinical isolates. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of
   honey-ginger extracts was 12.5\% (0.125 g/mL) for all the test
   organisms. Conclusion. The result of this study showed that honey-ginger
   powder extract mixtures have the potential to serve as cheap source of
   antibacterial agents especially for the drug resistant bacteria strains.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: The pharmacological activity of
   geopropolis collected by stingless bees (important and threatened
   pollinators), a product widely used in folk medicine by several
   communities in Brazil, especially in the Northeast Region, needs to be
   studied.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive
   activity of Melipona scutellaris geopropolis (stingless bee) using
   different models of nociception.
   Material and methods: The antinociceptive activity of the ethanolic
   extract of geopropolis (EEGP) and fractions was evaluated using writhing
   induced by acetic acid, formalin test, carrageenan-induced
   hypernociception, and quantification of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The
   chemical composition was assessed by quantification of total flavonoids
   and phenolic compounds.
   Results: EEGP and its hexane and aqueous fractions showed
   antinociceptive activity. Both EEGP and its aqueous fraction presented
   activity in the mechanical inflammatory hypernociception induced by the
   carrageenan model, an effect mediated by the inhibition of IL-1 beta and
   TNF-alpha. The chemical composition of EEGP and its hexane and aqueous
   fractions showed a significant presence of phenolic compounds and
   absence of flavonoids.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that geopropolis is a natural source of
   bioactive substances with promising antinociceptive activity. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that entrance guards of the stingless bee
   Tetragonisca angustula make less errors in distinguishing nestmates from
   non-nestmates than all other bee species studied to date, but how they
   achieve this is unknown. We performed four experiments to investigate
   nestmate recognition by entrance guards in T. angustula. We first
   investigated the effect of colony odours on acceptance. Nestmates that
   acquired odour from non-nestmate workers were 63\% more likely to be
   rejected while the acceptance rate of non-nestmates treated with
   nestmate odour increased by only 7\%. We further hypothesised that
   guards standing on the wax entrance tube might use the tube as an odour
   referent. However, our findings showed that there was no difference in
   the acceptance of non-nestmates by guards standing on their own colony's
   entrance tube versus the non-nestmate's entrance tube. Moreover,
   treatment of bees with nestmate and non-nestmate resin or wax had a
   negative effect on acceptance rates of up to 65\%, regardless of the
   origin of the wax or resin. The role of resin as a source of recognition
   cues was further investigated by unidirectionally transferring resin
   stores between colonies. Acceptance rates of nestmates declined by 37\%
   for hives that donated resin, contrasting with resin donor hives where
   acceptance of non-nestmates increased by 21\%. Overall, our results
   confirm the accuracy of nestmate recognition in T. angustula and reject
   the hypothesis that this high level of accuracy is due to the use of the
   wax entrance tubes as a referent for colony odour. Our findings also
   suggest that odours directly acquired from resin serve no primary
   function as nestmate recognition cues. The lack of consistency among
   colonies plus the complex results of the third and fourth experiments
   highlight the need for further research on the role of nest materials
   and cuticular profiles in understanding nestmate recognition in T.
   angustula.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of species is striking, but can be far exceeded by the
   chemical diversity of compounds collected, produced or used by them.
   Here, we relate the specificity of plant-consumer interactions to
   chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both
   levels. Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between
   tropical stingless bees and plant resins, which bees collect for nest
   construction and to deter predators and microbes. Resins also function
   as an environmental source for terpenes that serve as appeasement
   allomones and protection against predators when accumulated on the bees'
   body surfaces. To unravel the origin of the bees' complex chemical
   profiles, we investigated resin collection and the processing of
   resin-derived terpenes. We therefore analyzed chemical networks of tree
   resins, foraging networks of resin collecting bees, and their acquired
   chemical networks. We revealed that 113 terpenes in nests of six bee
   species and 83 on their body surfaces comprised a subset of the 1,117
   compounds found in resins from seven tree species. Sesquiterpenes were
   the most variable class of terpenes. Albeit widely present in tree
   resins, they were only found on the body surface of some species, but
   entirely lacking in others. Moreover, whereas the nest profile of
   Tetragonula melanocephala contained sesquiterpenes, its surface profile
   did not. Stingless bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among
   resin sources, and only a hitherto undescribed species-specific
   ``filtering{''} of resin-derived terpenes can explain the variation in
   chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different species. The
   tight relationship between bees and tree resins of a large variety of
   species elucidates why the bees' surfaces contain a much higher
   chemodiversity than other hymenopterans.}},

Title = {{In vitro antiproliferative activity of partially purified Trigona
   laeviceps propolis from Thailand on human cancer cell lines}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancers are some of the leading causes of human deaths
   worldwide and their relative importance continues to increase. Since an
   increasing proportion of cancer patients are acquiring resistance to
   traditional chemotherapeutic agents, it is necessary to search for new
   compounds that provide suitable specific antiproliferative affects that
   can be developed as anticancer agents. Propolis from the stingless bee,
   Trigona laeviceps, is one potential interesting source that is widely
   available and cultivatable (as bee hives) in Thailand.
   Methods: Propolis (90 g) was initially extracted by 95\% (v/v) ethanol
   and then solvent partitioned by sequential extractions of the crude
   ethanolic extract with 40\% (v/v) MeOH, CH2Cl2 and hexane. After solvent
   removal by evaporation, each extract was solvated in DMSO and assayed
   for antiproliferative activity against five cancer (Chago, KATO-III,
   SW620, BT474 and Hep-G2) and two normal (HS27 fibroblast and CH-liver)
   cell lines using the MTT assay. The cell viability (\%) and IC50 values
   were calculated.
   Results: The hexane extract provided the highest in vitro
   antiproliferative activity against the five tested cancer cell lines and
   the lowest cytotoxicity against the two normal cell lines. Further
   fractionation of the hexane fraction by quick column chromatography
   using eight solvents of increasing polarity for elution revealed the two
   fractions eluted with 30\% and 100\% (v/v) CH2Cl2 in hexane (30DCM and
   100DCM, respectively) had a higher antiproliferative activity. Further
   fractionation by size exclusion chromatography lead to four fractions
   for each of 30DCM and 100DCM, with the highest antiproliferative
   activity on cancer but not normal cell lines being observed in
   fraction\# 3 of 30DCM (IC50 value of 4.09 - 14.7 mu g/ml).
   Conclusions: T. laeviceps propolis was found to contain compound(s) with
   antiproliferative activity in vitro on cancer but not normal cell lines
   in tissue culture. The more enriched propolis fractions typically
   revealed a higher antiproliferative activity (lower IC50 value).
   Overall, propolis from Thailand may have the potential to serve as a
   template for future anticancer-drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Insects largely rely on olfactory cues when seeking and judging
   information on nests, partners, or resources. Bees are known to use
   volatile compounds-besides visual cues-to find flowers suitable for
   pollen and nectar collection. Tropical stingless bees additionally
   collect large amounts of plant resins for nest construction, nest
   maintenance, nest defense, and to derive chemical constituents for their
   cuticular profiles. We here demonstrate that stingless bees of Borneo
   also use olfactory cues to find tree resins. They rely on volatile mono-
   and sesquiterpenes to locate or recognize known resin sources. Moreover,
   by modifying resin extracts, we found that stingless bees do not use the
   entire resin bouquet but relative proportions of several terpenes. In
   doing so, the bees are able to learn specific tree resin profiles and
   distinguish between tree species and partly even tree individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Plant resins are used by stingless bees for nest construction and
   maintenance. To reveal factors that influence the bees' decision about
   where and when to collect resin, resin collection was studied in ten
   stingless bee species (Apidae, Meliponini) collecting resin at natural
   and artificially induced wounds of nine tree species in Borneo.
   Artificially induced wounds were found by bees within 1-2 d. The number
   of foragers at artificial wounds increased during the subsequent 5 d
   until resin secretion stopped or the resin hardened. At natural resin
   wounds, species identity and number of foragers remained constant during
   the observation period. Bees collected resin from some trees and ignored
   others. Agathis borneensis (Araucariaceae) was the most attractive resin
   source. The bees' visitation rate did not correlate significantly with
   resin wound size. Inter- and intraspecific aggression occurred at ten
   resin wounds. In Tetragonilla collina and Tetragonula melanocephala, we
   additionally recorded resin intake at colony entrances. The proportion
   of workers retuning with resin varied considerably between colonies. We
   observed attacks by ants at three of our eight focal colonies, which
   resulted in a significant increase in resin intake while the nest was
   under attack and until 1-2 d after the attack had stopped. The increase
   in resin collection triggered by ant attacks was even stronger than the
   increase following a manual destruction of the nest entrance tube.}},

   Tetragonisca angustula (Jata) and Apis mellifera ( honey bee) propolis

   the composition of A. mellifera propolis is highly region-dependent,
   whereas that of T. angustula propolis is nearly constant through the
   country, as was confirmed by principal component analysis. The constant
   chemical composition of T. angustula propolis is explained by the
   collection of resins preferentially from Schinus terebenthifolius, a
   plant source found throughout Brazil. This single source was determined
   via comparison of the components of the T. angustula propolis samples
   with that of plant extracts.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-two strains of the novel species Starmerella meliponinorum sp.
   nov. were isolated from various substrates associated with three
   stingless bee species (tribe Meliponini) in Brazil and one in Costa
   Rica. The strains were found in garbage pellets (faecal material,
   discarded pollen or food, etc.), pollen provisions, adult bees, honey
   and propolis of Tetragonisca angustula, in honey from Melipona
   quadrifasciata and in adults of Melipona rutiventris and Trigona
   fulviventris. The sequence of the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit
   rDNA showed that the novel species belongs to the Starmerella clade and
   is most closely related to Candida etchellsii, although the two differ
   in their sequences by 7\% base substitutions. S. meliponinorum is
   homothallic and assimilates few carbon sources. Nitrate is utilized as a
   sole nitrogen source. The type strain of S. meliponinorum is strain
   UFMG-01-J26.1(T) (=CBS 9117(T)).}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-one propolis samples produced by 12 different Meliponinae species
   were analyzed by GC-MS. Several chemical types of stingless bees'
   propolis could be grouped, according to the prevailing type of compounds
   like: ``gallic acid{''}, ``diterpenic{''} and ``triterpenic{''} types.
   The results confirm that neither the bee species nor the geographical
   location determine the chemical composition of Meliponinae propolis and
   the choice of its plant source, respectively. This could be explained by
   the fact that Meliponinae forage over short distances (maximum 500 m)
   and thus use as propolis source the first plant exudate they encounter
   during their flights. The antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic
   activities of the samples were also investigated. Most samples had weak
   or no activity against E. coli, weak action against Candida albicans.
   Some of them showed significant activity against St. aureus., presumably
   connected to the high concentration of diterpenic acids. Samples rich in
   diterpenic acids possessed also high cytotoxic activity (Artemia salina
   test).}},

Abstract = {{The phenolic compounds present in 38 propolis samples produced in
   tropical Venezuela by imported Apis mellifera and five indigenous
   species of stingless bees, and seven propolis samples from different
   temperate regions were analysed by HPLC. The different tropical propolis
   generally showed a single phenolic profile characterized by the
   occurrence of polyprenylated benzophenones as major components.
   Flavonoids were present in only a few samples, and in each case they
   were found to be lipophilic methylated 6-oxygenated flavones (eupatorin,
   hispidulin, 5-hydroxy-6,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone, etc.). Generally,
   no correlations between the composition of tropical propolis and the
   place of collection or the bee species were found. However, propolis
   from temperate areas contained flavonoids (with an unsubstituted ring B)
   as the main phenolic components (pinobanksin, pinobanksin 3-acetate,
   pinocembrin, chrysin, galangin and tectochrysin). These analyses
   confirmed that the source of the phenolics found in propolis produced in
   temperate regions was different Populus species of section Aigeiros
   (Salicaceae). The resins exuded by the flowers of Clusia minor and C.
   major (Guttiferae) contained the polyprenylated benzophenones found in
   the majority of the propolis studied, suggesting that this is the main
   source for propolis in tropical Venezuela.}},
