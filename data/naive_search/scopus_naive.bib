abstract={Propolis is a resinous beehive product that is collected by the bees from plant resin and exudates, to protect and maintain hive homeostasis. Propolis has been used by humans therapeutically to treat many ailments including respiratory tract-related diseases and disorders. The aim of the present systematic scoping review is to evaluate the experimental evidence to support the use of propolis as a primary or an adjunctive therapy in respiratory tract-related diseases and disorders. After applying the exclusion criteria, 158 research publications were retrieved and identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. The key themes of the included studies were pathogenic infection-related diseases and disorders, inflammation-related disorders, lung cancers, and adverse effects. Furthermore, the potential molecular and biochemical mechanisms of action of propolis in alleviating respiratory tract-related diseases and disorders are discussed. In conclusion, the therapeutic benefits of propolis have been demonstrated by various in vitro studies, in silico studies, animal models, and human clinical trials. Based on the weight and robustness of the available experimental and clinical evidence, propolis is effective, either as a primary or an adjunctive therapy, in treating respiratory tract-related diseases. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Propolis is a natural bee product that is widely used in folk medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) on methicillin-resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA). Propolis samples were collected from six regions in Hungary. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values and the interaction of EEP-antibiotics were evaluated by the broth microdilution and the chequerboard broth microdilution methods, respectively. The effect of EEP on biofilm formation and eradication was estimated by crystal violet assay. Resazurin/propidium iodide dyes were applied for simultaneous quantification of cellular metabolic activities and dead cells in mature biofilms. The EEP1 sample showed the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents. The EEP1 successfully prevented the growth of planktonic cells of S. aureus (MIC value = 50 µg/mL). Synergistic interactions were shown after the co-exposition to EEP1 and vancomycin at 108 CFU/mL. The EEP1 effectively inhibited the biofilm formation and caused significant degradation of mature biofilms (50–200 µg/mL), as a consequence of the considerable decrement of metabolic activity. The EEP acts effectively as an antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent on S. aureus. Moreover, the simultaneous application of EEP and vancomycin could enhance their effect against MRSA infection. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Propolis is a plant-based sticky substance that is produced by honeybees. It has been used traditionally by ancient civilizations as a folk medicine, and is known to have many pharmaceutical properties including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumour effects. Worldwide, researchers are still studying the complex composition of propolis to unveil its biological potential, and especially its antimicrobial activity against a variety of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. This review explores scientific reports published during the last decade on the characterization of different types of propolis, and evaluates their antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Propolis can be divided into different types depending on their chemical composition and physical properties associated with geographic origin and plant sources. Flavonoids, phenols, diterpenes, and aliphatic compounds are the main chemicals that characterize the different types of propolis (Poplar, Brazilian, and Mediterranean), and are responsible for their antimicrobial activity. The extracts of most types of propolis showed greater antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria: particularly on S. aureus, as well as on C. albicans, as compared to Gram-negative pathogens. Propolis acts either by directly interacting with the microbial cells or by stimulating the immune system of the host cells. Some studies have suggested that structural damage to the microorganisms is a possible mechanism by which propolis exhibits its antimicrobial activity. However, the mechanism of action of propolis is still unclear, due to the synergistic interaction of the ingredients of propolis, and this natural substance has multi-target activity in the cell. The broad-spectrum biological potentials of propolis present it as an ideal candidate for the development of new, potent, and cost-effective antimicrobial agents. © 2021 The Author},

abstract={Objective: The mango tree Mangifera indica is known as one of the botanical sources of propolis in Tropical regions. There are two different materials which bees can collect from a mango tree to produce propolis: the resin of the tree bark, and the latex found on the fruits. We performed the study of the chemical profile of mango resin in comparison with propolis in order to clarify its importance as propolis source. Results: We compared the chemical profiles (by GC–MS analysis of ethanol extracts after silylation) of the resin and samples of propolis: of stingless bees (3 Vietnames, 2 Indonesian), and one of Apis mellifera from Thailand. In the resin and all propolis samples, 25 compounds were identified: fatty acids, cardanols (alk(en)yl phenols), cardols, anacardic acids, triterpene alcohols and ketones, cycloartane type triterpenic acids. All samples have the same qualitative composition but there are important quantitative differences. Considering literature data on mango latex, we conclude that bees of different species, make use of the two propolis sources offered by mango: bark resin and fruit latex, in different proportions. We also confirmed for the first time the presence of alk(en)yl phenols and anacardic acids in the tree bark resin of mango. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Propolis is a honey bee product containing chiefly beeswax and resins originated from plant buds or exudates. Propolis resin exerts a diversity of biological activities, such as antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and defense of the hive against pathogens. Chemical standardization and identification of botanical sources is crucial for characterization of propolis. Types of Brazilian propolis are characteristic of geographical regions and respective biomes, such as savannas (Cerrado), mangroves, dry forest (Caatinga), rain forests (Amazon, Atlantic, and Interior forests), altitudinal fields (“Campos Rupestres”), Pantanal, and Araucaria forests. Despite the wide diversity of Brazilian biomes and flora, relatively few types of Brazilian propolis and corresponding resin plant sources have been reported. Factors accounting for the restricted number of known types of Brazilian propolis and plant sources are tentatively pointed out. Among them, the paper discusses constraints that honey bees must overcome to collect plant exudates, including the characteristics of the lapping-chewing mouthpart of honey bee, which limit their possibilities to cut and chew plant tissues, as well as chemical requirements that plant resins must fulfil, involving antimicrobial activity of its constituents and innocuity to the insects. Although much still needs to be done toward a more comprehensive picture of Brazilian propolis types and corresponding plant origins, the prospects indicate that the actual diversity of plant sources of honey bee propolis will remain relatively low. © 2021, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Insects entombed in copal, the sub-fossilized resin precursor of amber, represent a potential source of genetic data for extinct and extant, but endangered or elusive, species. Despite several studies demonstrated that it is not possible to recover endogenous DNA from insect inclusions, the preservation of biomolecules in fossilized resins samples is still under debate. In this study, we tested the possibility of obtaining endogenous ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules from insects preserved in copal, applying experimental protocols specifically designed for aDNA recovery. We were able to extract endogenous DNA molecules from one of the two samples analyzed, and to identify the taxonomic status of the specimen. Even if the sample was found well protected from external contaminants, the recovered DNA was low concentrated and extremely degraded, compared to the sample age. We conclude that it is possible to obtain genomic data from resin-entombed organisms, although we discourage aDNA analysis because of the destructive method of extraction protocols and the non-reproducibility of the results. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Beekeepers need sustainable control options to treat Nosema ceranae infection in colonies of western honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) they manage. Propolis is a natural product derived from plant resins and contains chemical compounds with potential antimicrobial activity against N. ceranae. Here, we determined the efficacy of propolis from A. mellifera (USA) and Tetrigona apicalis (stingless bees, Thailand) colonies as treatments for N. ceranae infection in honey bee workers. Newly emerged bees were individually fed 2 μL of 50% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 1 × 105N. ceranae spores. Following this, the infected bees were treated with 50% propolis extracted from A. mellifera or T. apicalis hives and fed in 50% sucrose solution (v/v). All bees were maintained at 34 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5% RH. Dead bees were counted daily for 30 d to calculate survival. We also determined infection rate (# infected bees/100 bees), infectivity (number of spores per bee) and protein content in the hypopharyngeal glands and hemolymph on 7, 14, and 21 d post infection as measures of bee health. Propolis from both bee species significantly reduced bee mortality, infection rate and infectivity compared with those of untreated bees and led to significantly greater protein contents in hypopharyngeal glands and hemolymph in treated bees than in untreated ones (p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, propolis from A. mellifera and T. apicalis colonies shows promise as a control against N. ceranae infection in honey bees. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Propolis is a resinous product accumulated from several plant sources that possess a wide range of therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer activities. However, the role of honeybee-produced propolis on head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Apis mellifera propolis on apoptosis and invasiveness in HNSCC cell lines. Methods: Ethyl acetate extract of propolis (EAEP) was prepared from A. mellifera beehives using liquid–liquid extraction. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) was used to determine the flavonoids in EAEP. Isogenic HNSCC cell lines derived from primary (HN30 and HN4) and metastatic site (HN31 and HN12) were used in this study. The cytotoxicity, apoptosis, invasion, and MMP activity of EAEP on HNSCC cells were determined using an MTT assay, flow cytometry, Matrigel invasion assay, and gelatinase zymography, respectively. Results: We found that EAEP exhibited cytotoxic activity and induced apoptosis in the HNSCC cell lines. Furthermore, EAEP significantly decreased HNSCC cell invasion by reducing MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. Two flavonoids, galangin and apigenin, were identified in EAEP by HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS. The results suggest that EAEP promotes apoptosis and exerts anti-invasion potential by inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in HNSCC cell lines. These inhibitory effects may be mediated by galangin and apigenin. Copyright 2021 Niyomtham et al.},

abstract={Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the etiological agent of caseous lymphadenitis in small ruminants, a chronic disease characterized by the development of granulomas in superficial and visceral lymph nodes as well as in several organs. An important characteristic of the infection with this bacterium is the formation of a biofilm and the absence of effective antibiotic therapy against the disease. From this scenario, the objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of C. pseudotuberculosis to conventional antibiotics and to red, green, and brown propolis extracts obtained by the supercritical and ethanolic extraction methods as well as its activity in the bacterial biofilm. The results of the sensitivity test using antibiotics indicated a sensitivity of C. pseudotuberculosis strains to the antimicrobial agents. The ethanolic extract of green propolis and the supercritical red propolis extract showed the best antibacterial activities against planktonic C. pseudotuberculosis. A lower antimicrobial activity of the brown propolis extract was identified. Propolis extracts were effective in interfering with the formation of the C. pseudotuberculosis biofilm but had little activity on the consolidated biofilm. In conclusion, propolis extracts are more effective against C. pseudotuberculosis in the planktonic stage, being able to interfere with the formation of bacterial biofilm. However, the action of propolis extracts in a sessile and structured microbial biofilm is reduced. © Copyright © 2021 Santos, Rodrigues, Kalil, Azevedo, Meyer, Umsza-Guez, Machado, Seyffert and Portela.},

Stingless bees use resin to build essential nest structures, repel predators, and kill would-be invaders. Furthermore, resin-derived compounds have been found to enrich the cuticular chemical profiles of many stingless bee species, and resin may play an important role in shaping the microbial communities associated with stingless bees and their nests. Despite its importance for colony function, previous reviews of resin use by stingless bees are lacking. This topic grows increasingly urgent as changes in beekeeping and land use practices occur, potentially diminishing stingless bees’ ability to incorporate resin into the nest environment. In this article, we review existing literature on resin use by stingless bees and discuss potential areas of future research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Propolis, a resin produced by honeybees, has long been used as a dietary supplement and folk remedy, and more recent preclinical investigations have demonstrated a large spectrum of potential therapeutic bioactivities, including antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, neu-roprotective, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antiviral properties. As an antiviral agent, propolis and various constituents have shown promising preclinical efficacy against adenoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory tract viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 300 chemical components have been identified in propo-lis, including terpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, with the specific constituent profile varying widely according to geographic origin and regional flora. Propolis and its constituents have demonstrated potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by modulating multiple pathogenic and antiviral pathways. Molecular docking studies have demonstrated high binding affinities of propolis derivatives to multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S-protein), and helicase (NSP13), as well as to the viral target angiotensin-con-verting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Among these compounds, retusapurpurin A has shown high affinity to 3CLpro (ΔG = −9.4 kcal/mol), RdRp (−7.5), RBD (−7.2), NSP13 (−9.4), and ACE2 (−10.4) and potent inhibition of viral entry by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues within viral and human target proteins. In addition, propolis-derived baccharin demonstrated even higher binding affinity towards PLpro (−8.2 kcal/mol). Measures of drug-likeness parameters, including metabo-lism, distribution, absorption, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics, also support the potential of propolis as an effective agent to combat COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={Propolis is a viscous, waxy, resinous substance that is produced from the exudates of flowers and buds by the action of salivary enzymes of honey bees. Propolis may differ in color (brown, red or green), with color being influenced by the chemical composition and age of the product. Propolis has a special distinctive odor owing to the high concentration of volatile essential oils. It is composed of 5% pollen grains, 10% essential and aromatic oils, 30% wax, 50% resin and balsams, and other minor trace substances. Natural propolis products may be useful for a range of applications in aquaculture systems instead of relying on the application of synthetic compounds to manage many ailments that affect business profitability. It has been reported in several studies that propolis enhances performance, economics, immunity response and disease resistance in different fish species. This present review discusses the functional actions of propolis and the prospects of its use as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, immune-modulatory, antiseptic, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory and food additive in aquaculture production. In summary, propolis could be a natural supplement that has the potential to improve fish health status and immunity thereby enhancing growth and productivity of the fish industry as well as economic efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Microbes have been identified as fundamental for the good health of bees, acting as pathogens, protective agent against infection/inorganic toxic compounds, degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites, definition of social group membership, carbohydrate metabolism, honey and bee pollen production. However, study of microbiota associated with bees have been largely confined to the honeybees and solitary bees. Here, I characterized the microbiota of indoor surface nest of four brazilian stingless bee species (Apidae: Meliponini) with different construction behaviors and populations. Bees that use predominantly plant material to build the nest (Frieseomelitta varia and Tetragonisca angustula) have a microbiome dominated by bacteria found in the phylloplane and flowers such as Pseudomonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. Species that use mud and feces (Trigona spinipes) possess a microbiome dominated by coliforms such as Escherichia coli and Alcaligenes faecalis. Melipona quadrifasciata, which uses both mud / feces and plant resin, showed a hybrid microbiome with microbes found in soil, feces and plant material. These findings indicate that indoor surface microbiome varies widely among bees and reflects the materials used in the construction of the nests. Copyright: © 2021 Leandro Pio de Sousa.

abstract={The objective of this work was to investigate the variability of physicochemical parameters, phenolic compounds and in vitro antioxidant activity of propolis collected from different apiaries in southeastern Mexico. A high variability was found in the moisture content (1.96-8.26%), ash (0.66-5.50%) and sensory characteristics of raw propolis from southeastern Mexico, but the raw propolis samples met the requirements of the quality regulations. In the same way, most of the ethanolic extracts also complied with the quality regulations. Of all the extracts, PE2 obtained from Santa Cruz showed the highest values for dry extract, content of total phenolic compounds (TPC), total flavonoids (TF) and antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS). The content of the individual phenolic compounds varied according to the geographical location of the apiary, but the PE2 extract resulted in the highest pinocembrin and chrysin content. A positive correlation was obtained between TPC and TF with antioxidant activity. Propolis extracts were classified into two groups through principal component analysis (PCA). These results indicate that the apiary location in southeastern Mexico influenced the characteristics of propolis. © 2021 Enrique Sauri-Duch et al., published by Sciendo 2021.},

The aim of this article is to provide comprehensive review of the antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties of propolis. The mechanisms of action of propolis are discussed. There are two distinct impacts with regards to antimicrobial and anti-parasitic properties of propolis, on the pathogens and on the host. With regards to the pathogens, propolis acts by disrupting the ability of the pathogens to invade the host cells by forming a physical barrier and inhibiting enzymes and proteins needed for invasion into the host cells. Propolis also inhibits the replication process of the pathogens. Moreover, propolis inhibits the metabolic processes of the pathogens by disrupting cellular organelles and components responsible for energy production. With regard to the host, propolis functions as an immunomodulator. It upregulates the innate immunity and modulates the inflammatory signaling pathways. Propolis also helps maintain the host’s cellular antioxidant status. More importantly, a small number of human clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of propolis as an adjuvant therapy for pathogenic infections. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the serious global public health threats that require immediate action. With the emergence of new resistance mechanisms in infection-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, AMR threatens the effective prevention and treatment of diseases caused by them. This has resulted in prolonged illness, disability, and death. It has been predicted that AMR will lead to over ten million deaths by 2050. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria is also causing old antibiotics to become ineffective. Among the diverse factors contributing to AMR, intrinsic biofilm development has been highlighted as an essential contributing facet. Moreover, biofilm-derived antibiotic tolerance leads to serious recurrent chronic infections. Therefore, the discovery of novel bioactive molecules is a potential solution that can help combat AMR. To achieve this, sustained mining of novel antimicrobial leads from actinobacteria, particularly marine actinobacteria, can be a promising strategy. Given their vast diversity and different habitats, the extraordinary capacity of actinobacteria can be tapped to synthesize new antibiotics or bioactive molecules for biofilm inhibition. Advanced screening strategies and novel approaches in the field of modern biochemical and molecular biology can be used to detect such new compounds. In view of this, the present review focuses on understanding some of the recent strategies to inhibit biofilm formation and explores the potential role of marine actinobacteria as sources of novel antibiotics and biofilm inhibitor molecules. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Heterotrigona itama is a stingless bee species from Meliponini tribe. The bee collects nectar, pollen and resin to produce honey, bee bread, and propolis. The bee is also known to visit and collect nectar from various types of flowers but there are limited studies on why this species of bee prefers to visit certain types of flowers. This study was conducted to identify the nectar concentration in selected flowers favoured by H. itama and the relationship between the bee and the morphology of the flowers. Nectar was obtained from different species of flowers and the concentrations were measured using a digital refractometer. The tube length of each flower species and the tongue length of the bees were also measured. The results revealed that flowers preferred by H. itama have high nectar concentrations. The tube lengths of the preferred flowers were between 2.0 and 4.0 mm, which is compatible with the tongue length of the bee. This study revealed that both nectar concentration and flower morphology are important factors for the bees in choosing their food sources. The results from this study will benefit the beekeepers in the identification of flowers that should be planted in their farms to improve stingless bee beekeeping activities. Understanding the relationship between the bees and their flower preferences could also help us to understand the importance of conserving both the bee colonies and the various species of flowering plants to ensure the sustainability of flora and fauna in the ecosystem. © 2021 Korean Society of Applied Entomology},

abstract={Background: Stingless bees (Meliponini), like honeybees Apis mellifera, collect plant resins in order to produce propolis (cerumen, geopropolis). This type of propolis has long been used in traditional medicine in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, India, and Vietnam, as a remedy for improving health and treating various diseases. The scientific and commercial interest in stingless bee propolis has been steadily increasing over the last few years. The new and growing knowledge in this field requires systematising, as a basis for further work. Recent reviews of Meliponini propolis deal only with the South American and Mesoamerican species, while reviews of the Asian, Australian and African species are missing. Furthermore, the chemical composition has not been thoroughly reviewed since 2007. Purpose: This review summarises and discusses the available data about the chemical composition of propolis from the stingless bee species (Meliponinae) of the Americas, Asia and Australia, published after 2007. The published information on the biological action of chemically characterised Meliponini propolis, and of individual constituents, is addressed. The plant sources of this propolis are also considered. Conclusion and perspectives: Chemical studies of Meliponini propolis has resulted in the discovery of new natural molecules, some of them with valuable bioactivity. Moreover, finding known molecules in propolis stimulates the study of their pharmacological properties. The enormous chemical variability of stingless bee propolis is a challenge to chemists, entomologists and pharmacologists. It is essential to perform pharmacological studies with only chemically characterised propolis of stingless bees. Further studies are required to chemically characterise and scientifically support the medicinal properties of stingless bee propolis and to clarify the potential for its commercial use. This could lead to increased prices for Meliponinae propolis and provide an additional source of income for farmers in rural communities with most serious social needs. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={This study aims to investigate the foraging behaviour of Heterotrigona itama in exploiting food resources at a residential area, and the viability of this species to adapt to urban microclimatic conditions. Heterotrigona itama prefers to forage at areas closer to their nesting site, where diverse food sources are found. The marked bees of H. itama prefer to forage on various resources available at a 500-metre radius from the house yard. The obtained results indicate that the active foraging pattern of H. itama is negatively correlated to the time phases of a day (p< 0.05). This phenomenon was contributed by the three peaks of foraging hours, which reached a peak in the early morning (6:30 to 8:00 a.m.), moderately peaked towards the evening (2:30 to 3:30 p.m.), and was greatest towards the afternoon (10:30 a.m.To 12:00 p.m.). The ambient temperature and relative humidity were not the primary factors influencing the average number of foragers exiting from and returning to the hives (temperature, pgt; 0.05; and humidity, pgt; 0.05). There was a difference between the varieties of content resources collected by the bees (p< 0.05). The nectar or water sources was the highest material (51.39%) that was brought back to the hive by foragers, followed by resin (34.73%) and pollen (13.87%). There was a significant difference in foraging time phases by returning foragers for collecting resin (p< 0.05) and nectar or water (p< 0.02), but there was no significant difference in foraging time phases found for pollen (pgt; 0.05). The results showed that H. itama is able to withstand urban microclimate conditions, and successfully incorporated pollen, nectar or water, and resin obtained from floral and non-floral resources into their diet. © 2021 Universiti Putra Malaysia.

abstract={Recently, the honey and propolis of stingless bees have been attracting growing atten-tion because of their health-promoting properties. However, studies on these products of African Meliponini are still very scarce. In this preliminary study, we analyzed the chemical composition of honey, two cerumen, and two resin deposits (propolis) samples of Meliponula ferruginea from Tanzania. The honey of M. ferruginea was profiled by NMR and indicated different long-term stability from Apis mellifera European (Bulgarian) honey. It differed significantly in sugar and organic acids content and had a very high amount of the disaccharide trehalulose, known for its bioactivities. We suggested trehalulose to be a potential marker for African stingless bee honey analogously to the recent proposal for Meliponini honey from Asia, South America, and Australia and demonstrated its easy discrimination by13 C NMR. Propolis and cerumen were studied by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectometry). The samples contained mainly terpenoids (di-and triterpenes) but demonstrated qualitative and quantitative differences. This fact was an indication that possibly M. ferruginea has no strict preferences for resins used to construct and protect their nests. The an-timicrobial and anti-quorum sensing properties of the two materials were also tested. These first results demonstrated that the honey, cerumen, and propolis of African stingless bees were rich in biologically active substances and deserved further research. © 2021 by the authors.

RP-HPLC-DAD was used to quantify the major compounds in the obtained extracts. The XTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the extracts in the human fibroblast cell line (GM07492A). The results revealed IC50 values of 102.7, 143.4, and 253.1 μg/mL for BRPE, DSE, and DLE, respectively. The extracts were also evaluated for their genotoxic potential in the micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts cells (V79), showing the absence of genotoxicity. The BRPE was investigated for its potential in vivo toxicity in the zebrafish model. Concentrations of 0.8-6.3 mg/L were safe for the animals, with a LC50 of 9.37 mg/L. Of the 11 compounds isolated from BRPE, medicarpin showed a selective cytotoxic effect against the HeLa cell line. These are the initial steps to determine the toxicological potential of Brazilian red propolis. ©},

abstract={In contrast to ancient Western and Asian cultures, medicinal plants of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia have not been as intensively studied for their molecular composition and molecular bioactivity. Syncarpia glomulifera subsp. glomulifera is a species in the plant family Myrtaceae. The resin of the plant has been traditionally used by the D'harawal people of Western Sydney to heal inflamed sores and ulcers. Hence, the anti-inflammatory activity of its leaf extract was investigated in RAW 264.7 macrophage and N11 microglia cell lines to isolate and identify the most active compounds. One new compound, tetragocarbone C, and three known compounds, tetragocarbone B, sideroxylin, and lumaflavanone A showed potent anti-inflammatory activity by downregulating nitric oxide and TNF-α production in LPS and IFN-γ stimulated cells. Except for the less potent tetragocarbone B, all compounds had an IC50 value (for nitric oxide downregulation) of &lt;10 μg/mL and moderate cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The molecular targets along pro-inflammatory signaling pathways were further investigated in RAW 264.7 cells. All four compounds suppressed phosphorylation of ERK, c-Jun, and limited the phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 in response to LPS and IFN-γ activation. The four compounds also suppressed NF-κB activation by preventing the translocation of the p65 subunit into the nucleus. Collectively, these findings suggest that the compounds isolated from Syncarpia glomulifera, especially tetragocarbone C and sideroxylin are promising anti-inflammatory agents, and could be further investigated for the treatment of diseases characterized by chronic inflammation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Propolis is a by-product of honeybee farming known for its broad therapeutic benefits around the world and is extensively used in the health food and beverage industry. Despite Australia being one of the world's megadiverse countries with rich flora and fauna, Australian propolis samples have not been explored adequately with most in vitro and in vivo studies centred on their Brazilian and Chinese counterparts. In view of this, our study was designed to investigate the chemical composition and anti-proliferative, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of Australian propolis (AP-1) extract to draw a comparison with Brazilian (BP-1) and Chinese propolis (CP-1) extracts. The AP-1 extract displayed significantly greater anti-proliferative activity against the MCF7 and the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cell lines compared to BP-1 and CP-1 (p < 0.05). Similar trends were also observed in the antibacterial (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus), anti-inflammatory (lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages) and antioxidant assays (ABTS, DPPH and CUPRAC) with AP-1 exhibiting more potent activity than BP-1 and CP-1. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with quadrupole high-resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS) and chemometrics implementing unsupervised PCA and supervised OPLS-DA analyses of the propolis samples from Australia, China and Brazil revealed 67 key discriminatory metabolites belonging to seven main chemical classes including flavonoids, triterpenes, acid derivatives, stilbenes, steroid derivatives, diterpenes and miscellaneous compounds. Additionally, seven common phenolic compounds were quantified in the samples. Further mechanistic studies are necessary to elucidate the modes of action of Australian propolis for its prospective use in the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.

abstract={Honey exhibits antibacterial and antioxidant activities that are ascribed to its diverse secondary metabolites. In the Philippines, the antibacterial and antioxidant activities, as well as the bioactive metabolite contents of the honey, have not been thoroughly described. In this report, we investigated the in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activities of honey from Apis mellifera and Tetragonula biroi, identified the compound responsible for the antibacterial activity, and compared the observed bioactivities and metabolite profiles to that of Manuka honey, which is recognized for its antibacterial and antioxidant properties. The secondary metabolite contents of honey were extracted using a nonionic polymeric resin followed by antibacterial and antioxidant assays, and then spectroscopic analyses of the phenolic and flavonoid contents. Results showed that honey extracts produced by T. biroi exhibits antibiotic activity against Staphylococcal pathogens as well as high antioxidant activity, which are correlated to its high flavonoid and phenolic content as compared to honey produced by A. mellifera. The bioassay-guided fractionation paired with Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) and tandem MS analyses found the presence of the flavonoid isorhamnetin (3-methylquercetin) in T. biroi honey extract, which was demonstrated as one of the compounds with inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-44. Our findings suggest that Philippine honey produced by T. biroi is a potential nutraceutical that possesses antibiotic and antioxidant activities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Foodomics is an emerging research field in food science that applies advanced omics technologies to assess relevant aspects related to food and nutrition, with the ultimate goal to improve human health and well-being. Many studies have already shown the tremendous potential of this approach to boost food science research regarding food authentication and traceability, safety issues, improved quality, bioactivity and the action of specific bioactive compounds in diverse biological systems. Honey bees provide high-quality products and a wide range of benefits to humans. Honey is certainly the most widespread edible bee product. However, nowadays other edible bee products [(royal jelly, propolis, pollen and naturally fermented pollen (bee bread)] are considered superfoods due to their high nutritional value and their beneficial effects on human health. This review aims to present current omics implementations in honey bee product research related to authentication (e.g. botanical origin, biomarker identification), adulteration detection, bioactivity (e.g. anti-microbial, antioxidant), microbiome characterization and their effects on human health. Conclusively, many studies have proven the tremendous potential of -omics technologies in bee product research. This approach will be further implemented in the future: (i) for the comprehensive assessment of bee product authentication, quality, safety and traceability; (ii) to elucidate the role of bioactive compounds in bee products, (iii) to identify novel molecular biomarkers for disease prevention; (iv) to establish the effect of bee products on gut microbiome; (v) to elucidate biological processes of agronomic interest and economic relevance to bee products. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Although nectar is consumed, primarily as a supplemental food, by a broad range of insects spanning at least five orders, it is processed and stored by only a small number of species, most of which are bees and wasps in the superfamily Apoidea. Within this group, Apis mellifera has evolved remarkable adaptations facilitating nectar processing and storage; in doing so, this species utilizes the end product, honey, for diverse functions with few if any equivalents in other phytophagous insects. Honey and its phytochemical constituents, some of which likely derive from propolis, have functional significance in protecting honey bees against microbial pathogens, toxins, and cold stress, as well as in regulating development and adult longevity. The distinctive properties of A. mellifera honey appear to have arisen in multiple ways, including genome modification; partnerships with microbial symbionts; and evolution of specialized behaviors, including foraging for substances other than nectar. That honey making by A. mellifera involves incorporation of exogenous material other than nectar, as well as endogenous products such as antimicrobial peptides and royal jelly, suggests that regarding honey as little more than a source of carbohydrates for bees is a concept in need of revision. © 2021 by Annual Reviews.},

abstract={Background: Natural products with antibacterial potential have begun to be tested on biofilm models, bringing us closer to understanding the response generated by the complex microbial ecosystems of the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities and chemical compositions of Peruvian propolis in an in vitro biofilm of Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Methods: The experimental work involved a consecutive, in vitro, longitudinal, and double-blinded study design. Propolis samples were collected from 13 different regions of the Peruvian Andes. The disk diffusion method was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test. The cytotoxic effect of propolis on human gingival fibroblasts was determined by cell viability method using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the effect of propolis on the biofilm was evaluated by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 0.78 mg/mL and 1.563 mg/mL concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the chloroform residue of Oxapampa propolis showed effects on biofilm thickness and the copy numbers of the srtA gene of S. gordonii and the radD gene of F. nucleatum at 48 and 120 hours, and chromatography (UV, λ 280 nm) identified rhamnocitrin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, kaempferol, diosmetin, acacetin, glycerol, and chrysoeriol. Conclusions: Of the 13 propolis evaluated, it was found that only the methanolic fraction of Oxapampa propolis showed antibacterial and antibiofilm effects without causing damage to human gingival fibroblasts. Likewise, when evaluating the chemical composition of this fraction, eight flavonoids were identified. © 2021 Millones Gómez PA et al.},

abstract={1. Overall, more than 30% of bee species depend on non-floral resources, such as resin. However, the importance of resin in bee ecology, particularly for solitary bees, has received very little attention thus far. 2. A plethora of loose natural history observations, inferences, and author opinions hint towards a striking range of uses of resin for nesting by bees. In this review, we focus on resin use in solitary bees and identify extant knowledge, knowledge gaps, and future research directions with regard to the functional use of resin in bee nesting biology. 3. Resin use in solitary bee nests can be broadly grouped by functional roles for nest structure, chemical camouflage, defence, moisture regulation, and anti-microbial properties. We point out that resin usage appears to be constrained by environmental and physiological factors. Bee species-specific tolerances for resin toxicity and resin availability in the environment seem to determine resin choices and subsequently functional usage in nests. We finally highlight that resin may play a major role in determining the ambient nest microbiota, due to its strong antimicrobial properties. We conclude that a better mechanistic understanding of resin use in bee nesting biology can aid in assessing species range shifts in light of global change. © 2021 The Authors.

This study was carried out to determine the total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity of water-extracted propolis samples from three different Indo-Malayan stingless bee species, namely, Tetrigona apicalis, Tetrigona binghami, and Homotrigona fimbriata. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric and aluminium chloride methods, respectively, while the antioxidant activity was analysed using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. Results indicated that H. fimbriata extracts exhibit the highest TPC, TFC, and antiradical activity among all samples tested. Interestingly, the data also showed that the higher the concentration of the extract used, the higher the antioxidant activity exhibited by the samples. Statistically, there were no significant differences recorded between the different bee species' propolis studied. In conclusion, the propolis extracts showed stronger antioxidant potential with higher TPC and TFC values. This study also noted the presence of bioactive compounds from local stingless bee propolis that could potentially be utilised for their medicinal and health benefits. © 2021 Sharifah Nur Amalina Syed Salleh et al.},

abstract={This study aimed to investigate the functional properties of four Algerian propolis collected from El-Menia, Oum el Bouaghi, El Harrouch and Collo regions. The total bioactive content, antioxidant, anti-enzymatic and antimicrobial effects of the four propolis methanolic extracts were evaluated using in vitro assays. The highest amount of total phenolic (561.99 ± 3.50 μg GAE/mg E) and flavonoid content (76.98 ± 0.26 μg QE/mg E) was found in propolis from El-Menia. Antioxidant tests (DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC and ferric reducing power) revealed the strong scavenging and reducing abilities of the extracts. Anti-enzymatic assays against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and α-glucosidase showed that all extracts possessed a potent inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase better than acarbose and revealed the ability of extracts to inhibit BChE more effectively than AChE. However, the extract of propolis from El Menia was the best inhibitor of the three key enzymes with IC50 values of 11.40 ± 0.58 µg/mL 16.06 ± 0.85 µg/mL and 71.29 ± 2.73 µg/mL against α-glucosidase, BChE and AChE, respectively. The antimicrobial assay indicated that all extracts were mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria and yeast and had bactericidal action in certain bacteria and bacteriostatic action in other ones. However, they had all fungistatic effect on C. albicans ATCC 10231. According to these results, Algerian propolis can be considered as a source of natural bioactive principles for dietary, pharmacological and medicinal applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

These mechanisms include apoptotic events; modulation of BAX, BAD, BCL2-L1 (BCL-2 like 1), and BCL-2; depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane; increased caspase-3 activity; poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage; and cell death induction by necroptosis via receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation. Additionally, the correlation between compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential is demonstrated that help in the prevention of cancer development. In summary, we highlight the important antitumor potential of propolis from stingless bees, but further preclinical and clinical trials are needed to explore the selectivity, efficacy, and safety of propolis. © 2021 Jaqueline Ferreira Campos et al.},

abstract={Stingless bees are responsible for pollinating up to 90% of Brazilian flora, so their study is of commercial and ecological importance. Stingless bees mix plant resins with wax and soil, forming geopropolis. Studies of the variability in composition and activity due to species, place and season of collection are lacking. Yield, total phenolic and flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity (via DPPH) of the extracts of fifteen M. quadrifasciata (Mandaçaia) geopropolis samples collected over a year in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, as well as two samples from different regions of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil were compared. Composition was determined by ultra-high-resolution liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, identifying 16 compounds. The month and region of collection affected the available plant resins and influenced their yield, composition and antioxidant capacity. Depending on the place of collection, M. quadrifasciata geopropolis is a promising natural source of antioxidant phenolic compounds. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Propolis is a resinous mixture, made by the honeybees from substances collected from tree or other plant buds, plant exudates, or resins found in the stem, branches, or leaves of different plants. The geographical origin of propolis is given by plant sources from respective areas. Different studies have classified this bee product according to the vegetal material from the same areas. Poplar-type propolis has the widest spread in the world, in the temperate zones from Europe, Asia, or North America. The name is given by the main plant source from where the bees are collecting the resins, although other vegetal sources are present in the mentioned areas. Different Pinus spp., Prunus spp., Acacia spp. and also Betula pendula, Aesculus hippocastanum, and Salix alba are important sources of resins for “poplar-type” propolis. The aim of this review is to identify the vegetal mate-rial’s chemical composition and activities of plant resins and balms used by the bees to produce poplar-type propolis and to compare it with the final product from similar geographical regions. The relevance of this review is to find the similarities between the chemical composition and properties of plant sources and propolis.

abstract={Propolis, a resinous substance, is collected from plants and processed by honeybees to seal holes and cracks in beehives, protecting them from microbial infection. Based on the plant source and geographical location, propolis is categorized into seven groups. Of these, Pacific propolis, found in the Pacific islands, originates from Macaranga spp. and is, therefore, known as Macaranga-type Pacific propolis. Okinawa propolis and Taiwanese propolis, which are both Macaranga-type propolis, are rich in prenylated flavonoids from the same botanical source, Macaranga tanarius, and are used locally as traditional remedies. They are reported to have a wide range of pharmacological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-melanogenic, and longevity-extending effects. However, not much is known about their mode of action, and recently, the extract of Okinawa propolis and its major prenylated flavonoids were found to selectively inhibit the oncogenic kinase, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). PAK1 enables cross-talking among several signaling pathways, causing many diseases/disorders. The existing results reviewed here support the use of Macaranga-type Pacific propolis for the effective development of safe herbal drugs and functional foods. Furthermore, its mode of action by modulating PAK1 can be explored, and the geographical and seasonal effects on its chemistry and biology, and its pharmacokinetics and toxicology should be studied as well. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Information on plants providing provisions (nectar and/or pollen) and nesting material for Megachile bees is fundamental for their conservation and habitat management to obtain optimal pollination services. Considering insufficient work reporting on these aspects in north India, studies were carried out to investigate the interactions between the plant species and the Megachile bees, through observing the adults foraging on the flowers and leaf-cutting activity on the leaves of plant species during regular visits. Observations on the leafcutter bees, viz. Megachile (Amegachile) bicolor Fabricius, Megachile (Eutricharaea) chlorigaster Cameron, Megachile (Aethomegachile) conjuncta Smith, Megachile (Callomegachile) relata Smith and Megachile (Eutricharaea) studiosa Bingham and five resin/mason bees - Megachile (Callomegachile) cephalotes Smith, Megachile (Callomegachile) disjuncta Fabricius, Megachile (subgenus - uncertain) inepta Cameron, Megachile (Pseudomegachile) lanata Fabricius and Megachile (Callomegachile) umbripennis Smith revealed that they interacted with 30 plant species for nectar/pollen and 19 plant species for leaf pieces from 17 plant families. The bees preferred the plants from the family Leguminosae for both provision and leaf pieces. Multiple interactions by different bee species were recorded for floral plants; however, the leafcutter bees had a distinctive choice in their leaf preferences while M. chlorigaster exhibited unusual behavior in using leaf types to build a nest. Megachile bicolor, M. disjuncta and M. cephalotes exhibited a wider range of plant interactions. Bee-plant interactions and their implications have been discussed. This study provides new information on the ecological requirements for nesting of Megachile bees which would be helpful in habitat management and developing effective tools for managed pollination. © 2020 International Bee Research Association.},

abstract={Stingless bees use extrafloral resources such as resins for nest construction, defense systems and chemical communication. We conducted the first study of the resin-collecting process from Croton yucatanensis Lundell shrubs by three stingless bee species in the tropical deciduous forest of the Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica. We performed systematic observations on 10 C. yucatanensis shrubs for 10-min periods between 8:20 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. for three days, and for 90 min we focused on behavior and interaction among bees on three shrubs. Trigona corvina Cockerell was the most frequent visitor. These bees made cuts on shrub stems and leaves to collect resin and transport it in their corbiculae. Others visitor species were Trigona fulviventris Guérin and Plebeia frontalis Friese, which tried to approach the resin remains left by T. corvina. While monopolizing the resource, T. corvina behaved aggressively if approached by T. fulviventris. Towards the last hour of sampling, T. fulviventris visits increased notably, which may indicate a decrease in the dominance or aggressiveness of T. corvina at that time. This tendency seems to be the beginning of temporal resource partitioning behavior commonly observed in bee communities. We provide novel observations on the ways in which stingless bees collect resin and the interactions that occur among them. We also propose and discuss working hypotheses to explain the fact that all the individuals observed almost exclusively visited a single C. yucatanensis specimen. © 2020, African Association of Insect Scientists.},

abstract={The kinetoplastids are protozoa characterized by the presence of a distinctive organelle, called the kinetoplast, which contains a large amount of DNA (kinetoplast DNA (kDNA)) inside their single mitochondrion. Kinetoplastids of medical and veterinary importance include Trypanosoma spp. (the causative agents of human and animal African Trypanosomiasis and of Chagas disease) and Leishmania spp. (the causative agents of the various forms of leishmaniasis). These neglected diseases affect millions of people across the globe, but drug treatment is hampered by the challenges of toxicity and drug resistance, among others. Propolis (a natural product made by bees) and compounds isolated from it are now being investigated as novel treatments of kinetoplastid infections. The anti-kinetoplastid efficacy of propolis is probably a consequence of its reported activity against kinetoplastid parasites of bees. This article presents a review of the reported anti-kinetoplastid potential of propolis, highlighting its anti-kinetoplastid activity in vitro and in vivo regardless of geographical origin. The mode of action of propolis depends on the organism it is acting on and includes growth inhibition, immunomodulation, macrophage activation, perturbation of the cell membrane architecture, phospholipid disturbances, and mitochondrial targets. This gives ample scope for further investigations toward the rational development of sustainable anti-kinetoplastid drugs. © 2020 by the authors.},

Different vegetal materials are collected by honeybees and mixed with wax and other own substances in order to obtain the final product, called propolis. It is known as the bee product with the widest chemical composition due to the raw material collected by the bees.

abstract={Bee-collected pollen (BCP) is a well-known functional food. Honey bees process the collected pollen and store it in the hive, inside the comb cells. The processed pollen is called beebread or ambrosia and it is the main source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, macro-and micro-elements in honey bee nutrition. During storage, beebread undergoes solid state fermentation which preserves it and increases the bioavailability of nutrients. Research on beebread has been rather limited until now. In recent years, there is an increasing interest regarding the antimicrobial properties of BCP and beebread, due to emerging antimicrobial resistance by pathogens. Both BCP and beebread exhibit antimicrobial properties against diverse pathogens, like bacteria and fungi. As is the case with other bee products, lack of antimicrobial resistance might be attributed to the synergy of more than one antimicrobial compounds within BCP and beebread. Furthermore, BCP and bee bread exert targeted activity against pathogens and affect the host microbiome in a prebiotic manner. This review aims to present up to date research findings regarding these aspects as well as to discuss current challenges and future perspectives in the field. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The present study focused on the evaluation of phytochemical properties, essential mineral elements, and heavy metals contained in raw propolis produced by stingless bees Geniotrigona thoracica, Heterotrigona itama, and Tetrigona binghami found in the same ecological conditions and environment in Brunei Darussalam. The results indicated that propolis of the three stingless bee species mainly consisted of lipids (45.60–47.86%) and very low carbohydrate (0.17–0.48%) and protein contents (0.18–1.18%). The propolis was rich in mineral elements, thus good sources of minerals, while they contained low concentrations of all heavy metals. Propolis of the different bee species could be distinguished based on their mineral compositions. The vibrational and absorption spectra suggested that propolis contains π-conjugated aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as aromatic acids having amine, ester, carbonyl, alkyl, and hydroxyl functional groups which might be attributed to the presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. The antioxidant capacity of the propolis, based on radical scavenging activity of their ethanol extract, was in line with their total phenolic content. The ethanol extract of the propolis also showed antimicrobial activities against four bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The propolis showed slightly higher antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (B. subtilis and S. aureus) bacteria, indicating that the antimicrobial active compounds could be associated with flavonoids, which were quantified to be approximately comparable in all the propolis. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Furthermore, it is an important marker for monitoring environmental pollution because the main sources of propolis are plant and secretions. So, the present study aimed to research radiation attenuation capability and the natural radioactivity level of propolis samples. For this reason, both natural radioactivity concentrations (226Ra, 232Th and 40K) and attenuation coefficients (Linear and Mass) in the propolis samples collected from 10 different points in Turkey were measured using high purity germanium detector (HPGe). The average natural radioactivity concentrations in samples were found to be 0.56 ± 0.19, 2.65 ± 0.31 and 70.08 ± 2.42 Bq/kg for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K, respectively. These values were much lower than the average world values (35 Bq/kg for 226Ra, 30 Bq/kg for 232Th and 400 Bq/kg for 40K) reported by United Nations Scientific Committee on Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) in foodstuff. The average linear attenuation coefficient, mass attenuation coefficients and half value layer values for gamma rays with 59.54 keV energy were determined as 0.1970 cm-1, 0.1831 cm2 g-1 and 3.56 cm, respectively.

abstract={Propolis has a very complex composition, with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and other properties. To determine the composition of ethanol extracts of Brazilian green propolis (EEP-B) and their protective effect on mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs), the chemical composition of EEP-B was analysed by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, and the protective effect of EEP-B on the proliferation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MAECs was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The protein levels of inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL-6) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expressions were analysed by western blotting. The results showed that a total of 24 compounds belonging to cinnamic acids and flavonoids, including 3,5-diisopentenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (artepillin C), kaempferide, 3-isoprenyl p-coumaric acid, pinocembrin and 40-methoxy pinobanksin, were identified in EEP-B. Among them, a new component, suggested to be 5-isoprenyl caffeic acid p-coumaric acid ester, was reported for the first time. The LPS-induced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 were downregulated in response to 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL EEP-B. This study revealed that EEP-B could reduce LPS-induced inflammatory reactions, improve cell survival, and protect MAECs by regulating ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression. These findings could provide a theoretical basis for MAEC treatment using EEP-B. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In this study, PR was dietary supplemented to hens for 4 weeks at a concentration of 0.1%. At the beginning of the 4th week of the experiment, hens from control and PR treatment were injected with E. coli (O157:H7; 107 colonies/hen) or saline. The results showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) negative impact of E. coli challenge on antioxidant status, immune response and productive performance. PR supplementation reduced (p &lt; 0.05) inflammation markers levels (tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)) and plasma corticosterone concentration. The antioxidant status was ameliorated with dietary PR supplementation to challenged hens, showing significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations. Cell mediated, as well as, humeral immune response improved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with dietary PR verified by the enhancement of T-and B-lymphocyte proliferation and the positive respond to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Leucocyte cells viability increased significantly and the apoptotic factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) was reduced with PR supplementation.

abstract={The development of new bio-friendly alternatives for wood conservation is of great interest and necessary for environmental protection. In this paper, the preparations based on the propolis extract and silicon compounds were used as green wood preservatives. The wood was treated with 15% propolis extract (EEP) and two propolis-silane preparations, namely, EEP-VTMOS/TEOS (EEP with vinyltrimethoxysilane and tetraethyl orthosilicate) and EEP-MPTMOS/TEOS (EEP with 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate and tetraethyl orthosilicate). The aim of the research was to determine the properties of treated wood, which was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the resistance against brown-rot fungus Coniophora puteana and the mechanical properties of treated wood were also determined. The analysis of phenolic compounds concentration in treated wood indicated that phenols were in greater extent leached from wood treated with the propolis extract than from wood impregnated with the propolis-silane preparations. The presence of silicon in treated wood both before and after leaching was confirmed by CP MAS NMR measurements. In turn, AAS and XRF analyses indicated that the degree of Si leaching from wood impregnated with EEP-VTMOS/TEOS was approximately two times lower than from EEP-MPTMOS/TEOS treated wood. The results of chemical analyses confirmed that the constituents of the propolis-silane preparations formed permanent bonds with wood. In turn, the results of the antifungal efficacy against C. puteana showed that the propolis extract and the propolis-silane preparations limited the fungus activity, even the wood was subjected to leaching procedure. The treated wood showed an increase in bending strength and a decrease in the modulus of elasticity compared to untreated wood. The obtained results indicate that the propolis-silane preparations can be promising green wood preservatives, harmless for the natural environment. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Propolis could represent an alternative therapeutic agent for targeting multidrug-resistant bacteria due to its antimicrobial potential. The effect of Brazilian green propolis (BGP) aqueous extract (AqExt) was evaluated on eight multidrug-resistant clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as on one reference strain for each bacterial species. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined and optimal concentrations were further evaluated in comparison with 0.12% chlorhexidine. The natural extract was chemically characterized by HPLC-DAD analysis. The MBC values ranged between 3.12 and 27.5 mg ml−1. Analysis of bacterial metabolic activity after treatment for 5 min with BGP-AqExt revealed a strong antimicrobial potential, similar to chlorhexidine. The extract comprised several active compounds including quercetin, gallic acid, caffeic and p-coumaric acid, drupani, galangin, and artepillin C. Altogether, the findings suggest that BGP-AqExt is fast and effective against multidrug-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in planktonic cultures and biofilms. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Stingless bees are a type of honey producers that commonly live in tropical countries. Their use for honey is being abandoned due to its limited production. However, the recent improvements in stingless bee honey production, particularly in South East Asia, have brought stingless bee products back into the picture. Although there are many stingless bee species that produce a wide spread of products, known since old eras in traditional medicine, the modern medical community is still missing more investigational studies on stingless bee products. Whereas comprehensive studies in the current era attest to the biological and medicinal properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) products, the properties of stingless bee products are less known. This review highlights for the first time the medicinal benefits of stingless bee products (honey, propolis, pollen and cerumen), recent investigations and promising future directions. This review emphasizes the potential antioxidant properties of these products that in turn play a vital role in preventing and treating diseases associated with oxidative stress, microbial infections and inflammatory disorders. Summarizing all these data and insights in one manuscript may increase the commercial value of stingless bee products as a food ingredient. This review will also highlight the utility of stingless bee products in the context of medicinal and therapeutic properties, some of which are yet to be discovered. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The loss of biodiversity during the Anthropocene is a constant topic of discussion, especially in the top biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar. In this regard, the study of preserved organisms through time, like those included in "Madagascar copal", is of relevance. "Madagascar copal" originated from the leguminous tree Hymenaea verrucosa, which produced and produces resin abundantly. In the last 20 years, interest has focused on the scientific study of its biological inclusions, mainly arthropods, described in dozens of publications. The age and origin of the deposits of "Madagascar copal" have not yet been resolved. Our objectives are to determine its age and geographical origin, and thus increase its scientific value as a source of biological/palaeobiological information. Although Hymenaea was established in Madagascar during the Miocene, we did not find geological deposits of copal or amber in the island. It is plausible that the evolution of those deposits was negatively conditioned by the type of soil, by the climate, and by the development of soil/litter microorganisms, which inhibit preservation of the resin pieces in the litter and subsoil over 300 years. Our results indicate that "Madagascar copal" is a Recent resin, up to a few hundred years old, that originated from Hymenaea trees growing in the lowland coastal forests, one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. The included and preserved biota is representative of that ecosystem today and during historical times. Inclusions in this Recent resin do not have the palaeontological significance that has been mistakenly attributed to them, but they do have relevant implications for studies regarding Anthropocene biodiversity loss in this hottest hotspot. © 2020 Delclòs et al.},

abstract={The dataset showed in this manuscript belongs to the investigation of the Southern-Brazilian geopropolis of stingless bees. Stingless bees are native species of insects from tropical areas; they produce honey, pollen and geopropolis that is composed of a mix of vegetal extracts, digestive enzymes, and mostly by soil. Used in folk medicine as antiseptic, antioxidant and antimicrobial agent, the composition is due to bee species, climate changes, local flora, and soil type. Moreover, the complex chemical content gives to the geopropolis a bioactive potential, with scavenging characteristics that is important to avoid free radical damages in the human health. Regarding the importance of exploring new natural matrices sources with bioactive potential, the first approach of chemical characterization of geopropolis is indispensable. Thus, ten samples of Southern-Brazilian geopropolis were analyzed and the bioactive responses obtained were discussed in the accompanying article titled “Southern-Brazilian geopropolis: A potential source of polyphenolic compounds and assessment of mineral composition”. Furthermore, the physicochemical analysis of moisture and ash content, the yield of extraction, the reducing activity and free radical scavenging potential of ethanolic extracts, the antimicrobial activity, and the analysis of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS chromatograms are the main data presented in brief. The data can guide scientists in order to know methods and data for these samples. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Bees collect vegetal resins that they mix with their wax and mechanical impurities to elaborate propolis, whose chemical composition is complex and variable depending on botanical/geographical origin, type of bee, time of year when it was produced and function in the hive. The presence of compounds that absorb UV radiation, such as those of the phenolic type: acids, esters, flavonoids and chalcones, largely responsible for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory biological activity has been reported. The objective of the present work was to establish if it was possible to differentiate Argentine propolis using UV spectroscopy and chemometric analysis, in the following cases: (a) Propolis elaborated by three different species of bees (Apis mellifera, Tetragonisca fiebrigi, Scaptotrigona jujuyensis) of the same geographical origin, and (b) Propolis produced by a species of bee (Apis mellifera) of four different geographical origins. UV spectrograms were performed in the 190–420 nm range for all the samples followed by analysis of principal components, hierarchical clusters and linear discriminants. The results showed that Argentine propolis could be differentiated in the two cases studied, and that A. mellifera, T. fiebrigi and S. jujuyensis would not use the same plant species to produce them. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The use of phytotherapy in medicine has given prominence to some natural products such as propolis, which consists of a resin produced by bees that is gathered from the shoots and exudates of plants. This product can be found in different countries such as Russia, China, Brazil, Cuba, Chile, and Turkey. The specific physicochemical characteristics of propolis are determined by its chemical composition, especially its phenolic compounds, and its main botanical origin, being classified as either red (Dalbergia ecastophyllum), green (Baccharis dracunculifolia), or brown (without specific main botanical origin). The variety of propolis compounds, such as flavonoids, appears to confer different biological properties to this product resulting in activities from antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant to anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. However, its bioactive compounds vary according to the climatic conditions, such as temperature and season. Different types of propolis have been evaluated in order to be applied in dentistry, mainly due to its effectiveness on the cariogenic biofilm control and fungal infections and in the case of periodontal disease or root canal contamination. Laboratory studies and clinical trials with propolis in different presentation forms have demonstrated a positive effect of this product against oral pathogens. In this sense, the present chapter aims to offer an updated review of the benefits of propolis from the perspective in oral health. © 2020 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini) collect plant resins and deliver them to their nest for use as construction material. In some species, however, workers can be observed leaving their colonies with resin loads on their corbiculae. The present study investigated the role of these "resin bees" in the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona subnitida. In 7 nests, we observed a total of 424 workers departing the nest under undisturbed colony conditions. One tenth (11.3%) of these outgoing bees carried resin on their corbiculae. The average weight of the loads was 5.2 mg, approximately, 10% of the bees' body weight. The round-trip duration of resin bees (1.3 min) was significantly shorter than that of nectar foragers (12.3 min). When the colonies were experimentally disturbed, the majority of the agitated bees that left the colony in response carried resin loads (90.5%). Our results suggest that resin bees in M. subnitida are nest defenders. Under undisturbed colony conditions, these bees may perform surveillance flights close to the nest, watching out for potential intruders and even mummify them with resin. Additionally, the deterrent effect of plant resins on many bee predators may reduce the workers' risk during these flights. © 2020, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).},

abstract={Land-use change and habitat loss have profoundly disturbed the resource availability for many organisms in farmlands, including bees. To counteract the resulting decline of bees and to maintain their pollination service to crops, bee pollinator-friendly schemes have been developed. We assessed the most established bee pollinator-friendly schemes which mainly aim at enhancing the availability of floral food resources and, or, nesting sites. We found that the availability of non-floral resources was typically overlooked in these schemes, although more than 30% of bee species worldwide depend on non-floral resources. In this opinion paper, we call for more attention on the role of non-floral resources in such conservation schemes. In fact, at least two of the most species rich Apoidea families, the Apidae and Megachilidae, need non-floral resources for nest building, defence, protection and health. For example, resin is known to improve health and resistance to pests and pathogens in stingless bees and the western honey bee Apis mellifera. Beyond social bees, many solitary bee species, in particularly within the Euglossini, Centridini and Megachilidae, also use resin, leaf pieces, trichome secretions and other materials for the construction and protection of brood cells and the nest. Besides protection, non-floral resources can also provide alternative food resources for bees, e.g. sugary secretions from other insects. Surprisingly little is known on this insect–insect interaction although some studies suggest that honey production by beekeepers can largely depend on this alternative food resource. The apparent knowledge gap on the role of non-floral resources for bees can thus directly concern stakeholders. Interestingly, many non-floral resources are provided by woody vegetation, but most of the bee pollinator-friendly schemes are currently orientated towards enhancing flower availability in field margins and flower strips. We therefore suggest more attention in the protection of trees and hedgerows in conservation, restoration and management schemes to best supporting bee health by providing combined access to nesting, floral and non-floral foraging resources. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Propolis possesses a wide range of beneficial biological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and other activities. It is available in food products and pharmaceuticals for health enhancement and preventive healthcare. Globally, the major exporters of propolis are China, Russia, and Brazil. Malaysia could also claim a share of the market because Malaysian propolis has been reported to contain compounds with medicinal value such as polyphenols, esters, flavonoids, terpenes, vitamins, minerals, and some enzymes. These compounds give Malaysian propolis its antioxidant, antibacterial, and antidiabetic capabilities. In this review, we assemble the latest research on the chemical composition, biological properties, and formulation techniques of Malaysian honey bee and meliponine propolis. There is a need to conduct comparative research on Malaysian propolis and the other sources that currently occupy the largest share of the global market to evaluate the utility of local Malaysian propolis. If comparative studies can identify the distinctive characteristics of Malaysian propolis, this may make it attractive to consumers. © 2020 Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.},

Nectar is the first reward for pollinators and the energy obtained from nectar for honey bee is essential for life. However, differences in nectar is a factor affecting honeybee behavior. Pollen is a vital nutrient for raising its larvae. In addition, the resin secreted by the plant means health and hygiene for honeybee.

The observation of flight activities of L. terminata were conducted from August to December 2016, at 07.00-17.00 for 1 minute with 1 hour interval. Pollen load and pollen types were analyzed by the acetolysis method. Flight activities of leaving and returning to the nest were lower at 07.00-08.00 (1 individual/min) and at 16.00-17.00 (2 individuals/min). However, the peak activities occurred at 10.00 until 13.00 (8 and 6 individuals/min for leaving and returning to the nest, respectively). Temperature and light intensity were positively correlated with flight activities of bees that carried nectar and resin, as well as leaving the nest without garbage.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of external activities of the bee Melipona fasciculata in different seasons and periods of the day. Four colonies were used for the study and evaluated for 12 months. The evaluated variables were inputs such as nectar/water inflow, entry with pollen, resin/clay inflow or unloaded bees exit and debris outflow. Evaluations were performed in the interval between 6 am and 6 pm of each month divided into three periods of four hours. The bee M. fasciculata performs inflow and outflow activity throughout the year and in all evaluated periods. Season and period did not influence resin/clay collection. The collection of pollen and nectar/water for the interior of the colony was greater in the spring. At the same time, the output of unloaded bee was also higher in the spring. In winter, spring, and autumn, pollen collection was highest between 10 am and 2 pm. Regardless of the season, the nectar/water collection by the bees was concentrated between 10 am and 6 pm. The exit of the colony with debris was influenced by the season and period of the day. With this study, it was possible to identify that the external activity of the M. fasciculata occurs in all seasons and periods of the day, however, these can be influenced by the increase or decrease of the daily activities. © 2020, © 2020 International Bee Research Association.},

abstract={Eusocial bee foragers leave their nest with nectar as flight fuel, therewith reducing the risk of starvation during a foraging trip. Yet, the extra mass results in an increase of energetic expenditure for flight. Thus, bees should tune their fuel loads to the respective foraging situation. In the present study, we investigated the fuel adjustment in the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona subnitida (Apidae, Meliponini). Specifically, we examined whether foragers of this species increase their fuel loads when they have low expectation for nectar collection during a foraging trip. Crop load measurements revealed that nectar foragers carried significantly less fuel on departing the nest than foragers collecting either pollen, clay, or resin. Surprisingly, 75% of nectar foragers left the nest without any detectable amount of nectar, which suggests that the majority of bees collected at nearby nectar sources and avoided an increase in foraging costs. Moreover, foragers increased their fuel loading when repeatedly experiencing empty food sources that had previously been rewarding. These results support our hypothesis and demonstrate that the capability of fuel adjustment is not restricted to honey bees. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This research aimed to determine the origin of organic residues from funerary contexts in the El Caño settlement (Gran Coclé area, Panamá, Central America) by means of multiple molecular probing techniques (GC-MS of organic solvent extracts and pyrolysis-GC-MS, THM-GC-MS and FTIR of solid samples). The samples include particles of precious resin figurines, fillings of golden objects, tomb sediments, plant exudates from extant plants (reference collection) and other reference materials (amber). The labdane diterpene fingerprints (eperuic, iso-ozic, copalic and kolavenic acids and derivatives) of the resin figurines, a resinous bead and several other samples, suggest that they were composed primarily of Hymenaea resin. Besides traditional interpretation approaches (visual comparison of chromatograms and relative proportions data), we used a novel OpenChrom® application that resolves complex pyrolysis chromatograms by screening data from archaeological samples for marker products defined on the basis of a reference collection (ChromIdent). ChromIdent confirmed the Hymenaea origin of many samples and also Burseraceae resin was identified in some samples, which is present as a minor ingredient in resin figurines (indicative of mixing practices) and as the dominant resin in tomb sediment that had been in contact with the corpses (indicating balsaming practices). The degree of polymerization of the Hymenaea resin was higher than for extant resin but diagenetic alteration (especially condensation of cyclic moieties) was much smaller than for amber, implying that the manufacturers used resin (or copal), not amber. These results were confirmed by FTIR, which allowed identification of non-fossil Hymenaea resin as the main constituent of one of the resin figurines. Several golden object infillings contained wax derivatives, probably beeswax, accompanied by various types of plant resin, which may well indicate the use of meliponines' cerumen for manufacturing (lost-wax casting). The findings highlight the potential of complementary molecular techniques to resolve questions on materials and manufacturing of archaeological artefacts, and the need for cross-comparison of molecular and ethnographic information in the study of archaeobotanical remains and the processes involved in their management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Apis dorsata Binghami is a Sulawesi endemic honey bee. Apis dorsata Binghami cannot be bred, so it still lives wildly in the forests of Sulawesi. However, Apis dorsata Binghami produces more honey, compared to all honey bee species. Furthermore, the diversity of plants as a source of nectar, pollen and plant resin, which is used in the formation of nests and honey is more, than all types of honey bees in the world. Ethnomedically, the Minahasa community has long used honeynest for degenerative diseases such as hyperlipidemia and cancer. Nevertheless, there have been no research reports on bioactive content and bioactivity of Apis dorsata Binghami nest extract. This research was aimed to determine the bioactive content of honey bee nest and to obtain the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) antioxidant activity of honey bee nest extract of Apis dorsata Binghami. Honey bee nest was obtained directly from the forest of Minahasa peninsula, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Extraction of fresh honey bee nest was conducted using maceration method. Bioactive content analysis was carried out by the Harborne method, followed by analysis using UV Vis spectrophotometer and High performance liquid chromatography. IC50 antioxidant activity of honey bee nest extract was obtained using DPPH free radical reduction method. The results showed that Apis dorsata Binghami honey bee nest extract contained alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, steroids and triterpenoids. Identified flavonoids displayed the highest phytochemical content. Based on the results of HPLC and UV Vis spectrophotometer analysis, there were 20 flavonoid derivatives found in honey bee nest samples in Minahasa. Ethanol extract and n-hexane extract showed high free radical reduction activity compared to vitamin C as a control treatment. However, ethanol extract produced the highest DPPH free radical reduction activity. © 2019, Universitas Jenderal Soedirman. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Propolis is a honeybee product that contains a mixture of natural substances with a broad spectrum of biological activities. However, the clinical application of propolis is limited due to the presence of a myriad of constituents with different physicochemical properties, low bioavailability and lack of appropriate formulations. In this study, a modified injection technique (spraying technique) has been developed for the encapsulation of the Egyptian propolis within liposomal formulation. The effects of three variables (lipid molar concentration, drug loading and cholesterol percentage) on the particle size and poly dispersity index (PDI) were studied using response surface methodology and the Box-Behnken design. Response surface diagrams were used to develop an optimized liposomal formulation of the Egyptian propolis. A comparative study between the optimized liposomal formulation prepared either by the typical ethanol injection method (TEIM) or the spraying method in terms of particle size, PDI and the in-vitro anti-proliferative effect against human melanoma cell line A375 was carried out. The spraying method resulted in the formation of smaller propolis-loaded liposomes compared to TEIM (particle sizes of 90 ± 6.2 nm, and 170 ± 14.7 nm, respectively). Furthermore, the IC50 values against A375 cells were found to be 3.04 ± 0.14, 4.5 ± 0.09, and 18.06 ± 0.75 for spray-prepared propolis liposomes (PP-Lip), TEIM PP-Lip, and propolis extract (PE), respectively. The encapsulation of PE into liposomes is expected to improve its cellular uptake by endocytosis. Moreover, smaller and more uniform liposomes obtained by spraying can be expected to achieve higher cellular uptake, as the ratio of liposomes or liposomal aggregates that fall above the capacity of cell membrane to “wrap” them will be minimized. © 2019 by the authors.

It is collected and brought very painstakingly by honey bees to be used for sealing cracks and crevices occurring in their hives. Originally, it as an antiseptic meant for preventing bee-hive from microbial infections along with preventing decomposition of intruders. Additionally, propolis has been used in folk medicine for centuries. The biological characteristics of propolis depend upon its chemical composition, plant sources, geographical zone and seasons. More than 300 compounds have been identified in propolis such as, phenolic compounds, aromatic acids, essential oils, waxes and amino acids. Many scientific articles are published every year in different international journals, and several groups of researchers have focused their attention on the chemical compounds and biological activity of propolis. © 2018},

abstract={Soliga tribes in the Western Ghats, India harvest some NTFPs (non-timber forest products) for religious purposes. They extract gum-resin from Boswellia serrata Roxb. in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (BRT), Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), and Malai Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary (MMH) in the state of Karnataka, India. They use gum-resin as a cultural offering to the deities in the temples in these study sites and in their households. The traditional harvesting practices adopted by the Soliga tribes in these protected areas, types of gum-resin extracted, and the nature of the extraction processes were examined. The research undertook 346 household surveys with gum-resin harvesters and non-harvesters across 15 villages, along with 60 field trips with the harvesters, during which field harvesting activities and practices were noted. Six different types of gum-resin were harvested, with marked differences between the three sites. Because of the different types of gum-resin, the quantities harvested were also significantly different between sites. Approximately 80% of the harvesters were aware of some harmful methods of harvesting gum-resin, and some harvesters highlighted that B. serrata trees would yield gum-resin only when damaged. Such damage could be human-made or through the effects of elephants, wind, Trigona honey harvest, deer horns or body rubbing and longhorn beetles. Most (81%) of the non-harvesters surveyed previously practiced gum-resin harvesting but had ceased for a variety of reasons, mostly because of insufficient demand and hence income from the sale of gum-resin, insufficient supply, or fear of wild animals in the forests. Considering these cultural practices, experiences, and beliefs of the Soliga communities can help inform management plans and conservation of the species in its natural habitat. © 2019 by the authors.},

This study focuses on the general characteristics of five samples of Polish extract propolis originating from agricultural areas. Chemical composition with high performance liquid chromatography‒diode array detector method, total content of flavonoids and polyphenols, and antioxidative activity were determined in the ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) samples. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) and time-kill curves were studied for foodborne pathogens and food spoilage microorganisms. In EEPs the predominant flavonoid compounds were pinocembrin, chrysin, pinobanksin, apigenin, and kaempferol and the predominant phenolic acids were p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid. A strong antioxidative action of propolis in vitro was observed (IC50 for DPPH radical was at the level of 0.9–2.1 µg/mL). EEPs had MIC values for bacteria in the range of 1–16 mg/mL, whereas MIC for fungi ranged from 2 to 32 mg/mL. Extract of propolis originating from southern Poland was distinguished by higher content of bioactive components, and stronger antioxidative and antimicrobial activity than EPPs from the remaining areas of Poland. The results indicate the possibility of applying ethanol extracts from Polish propolis to protect food against microbiological spoilage. © 2019 by the authors},

abstract={Stingless bees are highly social pollinators in tropical ecosystems. Besides floral pollen and nectar, they collect substantial amounts of plant resins, which are used for nest construction/maintenance and defence against antagonists. Moreover, some stingless bees extract chemical compounds from resins and incorporate them in their cuticular chemical profiles, rendering this trait directly dependent on the plant community of the surrounding environment. While previous studies have investigated how variation in the composition and diversity of available resin sources affect resin storages inside hives, subsequent effects on the bees’ cuticular chemistry have not been studied. To fill this gap, we investigated the number, proportion and composition of compounds in the cuticular chemical profile of an Australian stingless bee using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We analysed whether and (if so) how the cuticular chemistry was affected by habitat (i.e., plantations, forests, and gardens) and tree species richness. We found that overall numbers and proportions of self-produced and resin-derived compounds in the cuticular chemical profiles of Tetragonula carbonaria were similar across habitats, while the composition of all compounds (i.e., both self-produced and resin-derived) and of resin-derived compounds differed between habitats. This indicates that the surrounding tree species community and thus available resin chemistry affected the composition of particularly resin-derived compounds on the bees’ cuticle. As the number and composition of resin-derived cuticular compounds were not affected by tree species richness, stingless bees appear to selectively incorporate specific compounds available in the surrounding environment in their cuticular chemical profiles, which may increase their defensive properties. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This study evaluated the antileishmanial activity in vitro, cytotoxicity and chemical composition of geopropolis produced by M. fasciculata in the savannah region of Maranhão, Brazil. The geopropolis extract was obtained through maceration using in 70% ethanol. The hydroalcoholic extract of geopropolis after liquid–liquid partition yielded the hexane, chloroformic, ethyl acetate and hydroalcoholic fractions. Antileishmanial activity was evaluated against promastigote and intracellular amastigote of Leishmania amazonensis. Cytotoxic was realized in BALB/c mice peritoneal macrophages. Chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an ultraviolet–visible detector. The geopropolis inhibited the L. amazonensis promastigotes growth and was effective in reducing the infection of murine macrophages since the number of internalized amastigotes were smaller in cells treated with the geopropolis extract in relation to the untreated group. The ethyl acetate fraction was the most active and showed the highest index of selectivity as antileishmanial product. The geopropolis from M. fasciculata had an antileishmanial effect, mainly after the obtention of the ethyl acetate fraction that improved the activity without increasing the cytotoxicity against murine macrophages. Analysis for gas chromatography-mass spectrometer identified as main compounds the gallic and ellagic phenolic acids, either in the extract or in the active fraction. The results obtained by high performance liquid chromatography it was possible to confirm the presence and quantify the concentration gallic and ellagic acid either in the extract or in the active fraction. These results suggest that the antileishmanial activity of geopropolis is related to the presence of derivatives of these phenolic acids, mainly gallic and ellagic acids. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Farmacognosia},

abstract={Stingless bee products such as honey, pollen, propolis, and geopropolis have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for the treatment of several illnesses. Investigation of the biological activity of stingless bee products, especially propolis and geopropolis, has revealed promising therapeutic properties. About 20% of total Neotropical stingless bees can be found in Brazil. Despite the species diversity, studies on their biological activity are scarce. The present review focuses on the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of propolis and geopropolis from Brazilian stingless bees. In addition, the toxicity of these natural products was addressed. In order to provide new evidences for the toxic potential of propolis and geopropolis components, an in silico analysis was performed using the ADMET PredictorTM software. We observed that most of studies evaluated only crude ethanol extracts of a limited number of stingless bees species. Propolis and geopropolis displayed antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity. Concerning the toxic potential, the extracts of stingless bees propolis and geopropolis were considered safe. Nonetheless, in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies are still necessary. © 2018},

abstract={Tropical and subtropical plants provide to pollinators a range of nutritive and non-nutritive materials as alternative to pollen and nectar, including resins, which are gathered by females of several groups of social and solitary bees. Although resin-like material has previously been recorded in Maxillariinae, these investigations generally did not present data relating to pollinators. In fact, the collection of resins has never been recorded elsewhere in orchids. The aim of this paper was to provide a detailed study of the reproductive biology of an Amazonian Heterotaxis, H. superflua, based on records of flowering phenology, floral morphology, pollinator behavior and breeding system. Heterotaxis superflua offers resin-like material to pollinators and is pollinated by a single species of stingless bee. The resin is a heterogeneous material rich in mucilage, starch and sugars, while lipoidal substances occur as small droplets. Chemical analyses confirm the presence of sugar, which explain the presence of reducing sugars and mucilage detected in the histochemical investigations. Our data also showed the Heterotaxis is self-compatible and pollinator dependent. This study demonstrates for the first time the collection of resin-like material in orchids. The gathering of resin is frequently associated with the nest construction, since this material is considered to be a water-repellent and has anti-pathogen chemical properties. Despite offering of a floral reward, fruit set under natural conditions is lower than for experimental pollinations, suggesting limited pollen flow within the population. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Social insects have evolved colony behavioral, physiological, and organizational adaptations (social immunity) to reduce the risks of parasitization and/or disease transmission. The collection of resin from various plants and its use in the hive as propolis is a clear example of behavioral defense. For Apis mellifera, an increased propolis content in the hive may correspond to variations in the microbial load of the colony and to a downregulation of an individual bee's immune response. However, many aspects of such antimicrobial mechanism still need to be clarified. Assuming that bacterial and fungal infection mechanisms differ from the action of a parasite, we studied the resin collection dynamics in Varroa destructor-infested honeybee colonies. Comparative experiments involving hives with different mite infestation levels were conducted in order to assess the amount of resin collected and propolis quality within the hive, over a 2-year period (2014 and 2015). Our study demonstrates that when A. mellifera colonies are under stress because of Varroa infestation, an increase in the number of resin foragers is recorded, even if a general intensification of the foraging activity is not observed. A reduction in the total polyphenolic content in propolis produced in infested versus uninfested hives was also noticed. Considering that different propolis types show varying levels of inhibition against a variety of honey bee pathogens in vitro, it would be very important to study the effects against Varroa of two diverse types of propolis: from Varroa-free and from Varroa-infested hives. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

abstract={Propolis is one of the most fascinating honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) products. It is a plant derived product that bees produce from resins that they collect from different plant organs and with which they mix beeswax. Propolis is a building material and a protective agent in the bee hive. It also plays an important role in honey bee social immunity, and is widely used by humans as an ingredient of nutraceuticals, over-the-counter preparations and cosmetics. Its chemical composition varies by geographic location, climatic zone and local flora. The understanding of the chemical diversity of propolis is very important in propolis research. In this manuscript, we give an overview of the available methods for studying propolis in different aspects: propolis in the bee colony; chemical composition and plant sources of propolis; biological activity of propolis with respect to bees and humans; and approaches for standardization and quality control for the purposes of industrial application. © 2016, © 2016 International Bee Research Association.},

abstract={This study clarifies the chemical constituents and botanical origin ofTetragonula sapiens Cockerell bee propolis collected from Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Propolis samples and resin of Mangifera indica were extracted with 99% ethanol to obtain an ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) and an ethanol extract of M. indica resin (EEM). Column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were developed and used for the separation and isolation of compounds from the ether-soluble fraction. The structure of the compounds was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis, and their molecular weight analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The HPLC chromatogram of the EEP was then compared with the HPLC chromatogram of EEM to investigate the botanical origin of propolis. Five compounds were isolated from the EEP, and their structures were determined as mangiferolic acid, cycloartenol, ambonic acid, mangiferonic acid, and ambolic acid, which are cycloartane-type triterpenes. The characteristic peak of the HPLC chromatograms of EEP and EEM showed a similar pattern, which is that the main components of propolis were also found in M. indica resin. These results suggested that the propolis from Southeast Sulawesi was rich in cycloartane-type triterpenes, and the plant source of the propolis could beMangifera indica (mango). © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Hydrophilic magnetic molecular imprinted resins (MMIRs) were firstly fabricated by one-pot copolycondensation of resorcinol, melamine, and formaldehyde in the pores of Fe3O4 @mSiO2. The porous structure of mSiO2 limited copolycondensation. After the removal of mSiO2, controllable imprinting shell thickness (about 5 nm) was formed, reducing the probability of embedded sites, favoring the efficient adsorption. Moreover, the reaction time (3 h) was just 1/5−1/8 of those synthesized by conventional heating method. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), water contact angle analysis, and Brunauer‒Emmett‒Teller (BET) analysis indicated the successful preparation of MMIRs with excellent hydrophilic property, and magnetic separation characteristics. Steady-state adsorption studies showed that the resultant MMIRs had specific recognition for benzoic acids, GA, protocatechuic acid (PCA), vanillic acid (VA), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), salicylic acid (SA), and benzoic acid (BA). MMIRs combination with high-performance liquid chromatography–ultraviolet (HPLC–UV) were then directly used for selective extraction and determination of benzoic acids in river water, fruit juices, and human serum. Obtained limits of detection (LOD) and recoveries were in the range of 0.02–1.0 μg/mL, and 81.8–108.7%, respectively, and the batch-to-batch relative standard deviation (RSD) was 5.9%. The proposed strategy showed excellent hydrophilicity and specificity, which was promising for detection of benzoic acids in real aqueous samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are threatened by numerous pathogens and parasites. To prevent infections they apply cooperative behavioral defenses, such as allo-grooming and hygiene, or they use antimicrobial plant resin. Resin is a chemically complex and highly variable mixture of many bioactive compounds. Bees collect the sticky material from different plant species and use it for nest construction and protection. Despite its importance for colony health, comparatively little is known about the precise origins and variability in resin spectra collected by honeybees. To identify the botanical resin sources of A. mellifera in Western Europe we chemically compared resin loads of individual foragers and tree resins. We further examined the resin intake of 25 colonies from five different apiaries to assess the effect of location on variation in the spectra of collected resin. Across all colonies and apiaries, seven distinct resin types were categorized according to their color and chemical composition. Matches between bee-collected resin and tree resin indicated that bees used poplar (Populus balsamifera, P. x canadensis), birch (Betula alba), horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) and coniferous trees (either Picea abies or Pinus sylvestris) as resin sources. Our data reveal that honeybees collect a comparatively broad and variable spectrum of resin sources, thus assuring protection against a variety of antagonists sensitive to different resins and/or compounds. We further unravel distinct preferences for specific resins and resin chemotypes, indicating that honeybees selectively search for bioactive resin compounds. © 2019 Drescher et al.

abstract={The natural product produced by stingless bees such as honey, beehive, pollen and propolis are well known for their benefits and has been used as traditional medicine by the Asian community. Trigona itama known as "lebah kelulut" by Malaysia community are widely distributed in Sarawak and T. itama are the main local species used by our local industries involved in commercialization of stingless bee products. Limited research and data on T. itama propolis, which resulted in less demand in industrial sectors than honeybee propolis. Biological activity and chemical constituent of T. itama propolis are influenced on the vegetation in T. itama habitat. Propolis is a by-product of T. itama bees that are produced by a combination of beeswax and resins. This study aims to identify the antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities of Sarawak T. itama propolis in hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts. Antioxidant activities of T. itama propolis was identified using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) solvent and measured using UV spectrophotometer. The antibacterial activity of T.itama propolis was evaluated by using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The sample of concentration 500, 750 and 1000 ug/mL were treated on the blank disc to determine the antimicrobial activity of propolis. The result from this study shows that all T. itama propolis extract possesses antioxidant activity and methanol extract (EC50 17.18) show the highest antioxidant activity compared to ascorbic acid (EC50 21.05). T. itama propolis extract has anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. All T. itama propolis crude extract show a low level of toxicity in Brine shrimp lethality test. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The propolis produced by stingless bees of the tribe Meliponini is a viscous product that contains the resin collected from buds, leaves and plant exudates, mixed with salivary secretions, wax and soil. The species Scaptotrigona aff. postica (Latreille, 1807), (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponinae) popularly known as “tubi” in Maranhão State, Brazil, does not mix soil to produce its propolis. The propolis from S. postica harvested in Barra do Corda, Maranhão State, is popularly used in the treatment of wounds and respiratory illnesses. The hydroalcoholic extract of this propolis, rich in flavone-6,8-di-C-glycosides (vicenin-2 and schaftoside), pyrrolizidine alkaloids derived from retronecine, catechin and caffeoylquinic acid derivatives exhibited antiviral activity against the herpes simplex and rubella viruses. The aim of this study was to increase knowledge about the chemical composition of the S. postica propolis by analyzing non-polar extracts obtained using hexane and chloroform as the solvents, by GC-EI-MS. A total of 15 constituents were identified comparing their respective mass spectral data with those available in the NIST data bases and those reported in the literature. The main constituents detected were the phenolic lipids, known as cardanols, 3-(4,7-heptadecadienyl) phenol (5), 3-(10-heptadecenyl) phenol (7), 3-heptadecylphenol (9) and 3-pentadecyl phenol or hydrocardanol (13), which predominated in the hexane extract, while the predominant constituents in the chloroform extract were 3-pentadecyl phenol or hydrocardanol (13) and 3-(8-pentadecenyl) phenol (12). The antioxidant, antitumoral, antifeedant, cytotoxic, anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, antileishmanial and larvicidal activities of the cardanols have been demonstrated in many studies. © 2019 Instituto de Tecnologia de Alimentos - ITAL.

Phytochemical screening was carried out on aqueous and ethanol extracts of bee bread. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents, free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing activity of the extracts were also assessed. All samples had essential and non-essential amino acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fat, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, xanthoproteins, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids, saponins, resins, and antioxidant activities. Sample from Kelantan had the significantly highest content of alanine, glycine and isoleucine, while sample from Selangor had the highest content of carbohydrate, total energy and proline. Sample from Perak had the highest content of fat. Bee bread ethanol extract demonstrated significantly higher antioxidant properties compared to bee bread aqueous extract with the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents in sample from Perak and the highest free radical scavenging activity in sample from Selangor. Bee bread from Malaysia has good nutritional and antioxidant properties, which might indicate its potential to be a dietary supplement.

abstract={Background: As a natural bioproduct obtained from beekeeping, propolis – with its antimicrobial and antioxidative properties – can be used in food production. Scope and approach: This review discusses methods for obtaining propolis extracts (EP), application of propolis in antimicrobial and antioxidative protection of food, and the influence of propolis on the physical, chemical, and sensory properties of food. In addition, the allergenic potential of propolis is presented, together with the legal status of propolis application in food production. Key findings and conclusions: In food production, EP are used primarily in ethanol, or water/ethanol, because of its low wax content and high content of bioactive compound. The addition of EP enhances the microbial durability and quality of foods during storage. EP are added directly to foods, or are administered superficially through immersing foods in EP or by applying special EP coats. These procedures reduce pathogen counts or completely eliminate pathogens that are transferred by foods and the saprophytic microbiota of meat, fishes, fruits, vegetables, fruit juices, and milk. Propolis can be used as an antioxidant, particularly in meat and fish products, and can confer protection of the antioxidative properties of fruits and juices during storage. Moreover, it contributes to the physical and chemical properties of food, thereby maintaining the quality of food during storage. A disadvantage of propolis is its unique flavor and aroma, which may negatively alter the sensory properties of foods to which it is added. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Propolis is a natural product with many demonstrated biological activities and propolis extract has been used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Different works have showed the variations in the chemical composition, and consequently, on the biological activity of the propolis that are associated with its type and geographic origin. Due to this study evaluated propolis extracts obtained through supercritical extraction and ethanolic extraction (conventional) in three samples of different types of propolis (red, green and brown), collected from different regions in Brazil (state of Bahia). Analyses were performed to determine the humidity, water activity, the content of total ash, proteins, lipids and fiber in raw propolis samples. The content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, in vitro antioxidant activity (DPPH), catechin, ferulic acid and luteolin and antimicrobial activity against two bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) were determined for all extracts. For the green and red ethanolic extracts the anti-leishmanicidal potential was also evaluated. The physicochemical profiles showed agreement in relation to the literature. The results identified significant differences among the extracts (p>0.05), which are in conformity with their extraction method, as well as with type and botanical origin of the samples. The extraction with supercritical fluid was not efficient to obtain extracts with the highest contents of antioxidants compounds, when compared with the ethanolic extracts. The best results were shown for the extracts obtained through the conventional extraction method (ethanolic) indicating a higher selectivity for the extraction of antioxidants compounds. The red variety showed the largest biological potential, which included the content of antioxidants compounds. The results found in this study confirm the influence of the type of the raw material on the composition and characteristics of the extracts. The parameters analysis were important to characterize and evaluate the quality of the different Brazilian propolis extracts based on the increased use of propolis by the natural products industry. © 2018 Devequi-Nunes et al.

abstract={Honeybees rely on plants for everything they need to keep the colony running; plant nectar and pollen are their only carbohydrate and protein food sources. By foraging to satisfy their basic nutritional demand, honeybees inevitably gather specialized plant metabolites as part of the nectar and pollen. In general, these compounds possess biological activity which may become relevant in fighting pests and pathogens in the hive. The third plant derived bee product, besides honey and bee pollen, is propolis (bee glue), which comes from plant resins. It is not a food; it is used as a building material and a defensive substance. Thus, the beehive is rich in specialized plant metabolites, produced by many different plant species and the expression “Phytochemistry of honeybees” is not inappropriate. However, it is virtually impossible to perform a detailed overview of the phytochemical features of honey and pollen in a review article of this nature, for reasons of space. The present review deals with propolis, because it is the bee product with highest concentration of specialized plant metabolites and has valuable pharmacological activities. The most recent developments concerning plant sources of propolis, bees’ preferences to particular plants, the application of metabolomic approaches and chemometrics to propolis research and the problems concerning standardization of propolis are summarized. The overview covers the literature published in the last decade, after 2007. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Social insects construct nests that protect their brood and food resources from both the physical environment and natural enemies. Stingless bees use plant-derived resins, mixed with wax to form propolis, in the construction of their nests, and these products can be effective sources of defense against natural enemies, including ants. However, it is not known whether this defense, in the form of deterring or repelling workers, derives from the physical properties or chemical compounds of these products. The nest entrance of Tetragonula carbonaria is constructed with propolis and Corymbia resins, and we ask whether nonvolatile chemicals present in these products act as a defense against ants. Our field experiments revealed that workers of Iridomyrmex mayri Forel were deterred from crossing a chemical barrier comprising nonvolatile, nonpolar (hexane) extracts of propolis and Corymbia tree resin. However, polar (ethanol) extracts did not have this effect. These data are the first to demonstrate that the chemical components alone of entrance propolis and resins can provide a nest-defense function against ants. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Objective: The efficacy of a red propolis hydro-alcoholic extract (RP) in controlling Streptococcus mutans biofilm colonization was evaluated. The effect of RP on dental demineralization was also investigated. Methods: Chemical composition was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Minimum Inhibitory and Bactericidal Concentration (MIC and MBC, respectively) were investigated against Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175). The cytotoxic potential of 3% RP in oral fibroblasts was observed after 1 and 3 min. Bovine dental enamel blocks (N = 24) were used for S. mutans biofilm formation (48 h), simulating ‘feast or famine’ episodes. Blocks/biofilms were exposed 2×/day, for 3 days, to a cariogenic challenge with sucrose 10% (5 min) and treated (1 min) with: 0.85% saline solution (negative control), 0.12% Chlorhexidine (CHX, positive control for biofilm colonization), 0.05% Sodium Fluoride (NaF, positive control to avoid demineralization) and 3% RP. Biofilms were assessed for viability (CFU/mL), and to observe the concentration of soluble and insoluble extracellular polysaccharides (SEPS and IEPS). Dental demineralization was assessed by the percentage of surface hardness loss (%SHL) and through polarized light microscopy (PLM). Results: The RP presented 4.0 pH and ºBrix = 4.8. The p-coumaric acid (17.2 μg/mL) and luteolin (15.23 μg/mL) were the largest contents of phenolic acids and flavonoids, respectively. MIC and MBC of RP were 293 μg/mL and 1172 μg/mL, respectively. The 3% RP showed 43% of viably cells after 1 min. Lower number (p &lt; 0.05) of viable bacteria (CFU/mL) was observed after CHX (1.8 × 105) followed by RP (1.8 × 107) treatments. The lowest concentration (μg/CFU) of SEPS (12.6) and IEPS (25.9) was observed in CHX (p &lt; 0.05) followed by RP (17.1 and 54.3), and both differed from the negative control (34.4 and 63.9) (p &lt; 0.05). Considering the %SHL, all groups differed statistically (p &lt; 0.05) from the negative control (46.6%); but NaF (13.9%), CHX (20.1%) and RP (20.7%) did not differ among them (p &gt; 0.05). After all treatments, suggestive areas of caries lesions were observed by PLM, which were lower for CHX and NaF. Conclusion: The 3% RP reduced S. mutans colonization, decreased concentration of extracellular polysaccharides and reduced dental enamel demineralization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Tetrigona apicalis (Smith, 1857) is a common species of stingless bee found in lower northern Thailand. In previous studies, the propolis of stingless bees has been shown to have antibacterial properties, due to its chemically contained phenolic contents. The major component of propolis is resin. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of crude resin extracts by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. We also determined the total phenolic contents using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and, to detect individual polyphenolic contents, we used the high performance liquid chromatographic method. Two samples of resin were collected from Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Phitsanulok. The first sample was from fresh plants, which stingless bees used for nest construction. The second sample was taken from entrances of the bee’s nest. All samples were macerated in 30 % ethanol and incubated at room temperature for 14 days. The supernatants were filtered and ethanol residues then removed as ethanolic resin extracts (eREs). The antibacterial activity of the extracted resins against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was examined. The disks containing 9 and 14 mg of eREs produced obvious inhibition zones against S. aureus, but did not show zones against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the eREs against the bacterial strains tested were variously between 6 and 48 mg/ml, whereas the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were from 12 to 48 mg/ml. The amount of the total phenolic compounds in the eREs from the fresh resin was 9,908 mg of pyrogallol equivalent (PGE) per kg of eREs, and from the nest entrances, 14,740 mg per kg. We also found that hydroquinin had the highest concentration in both extracts. In conclusion, the crude resin extracts demonstrated antibacterial properties against the S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa strains tested. They also contained phenolic compounds which were active antibacterial agents. We have identified new and novel knowledge which can be used as preliminary data, leading to further, more detailed, investigation of the mechanistic action of the resin against bacterial cells. © 2018, Walailak University.

abstract={Amber is fossilised plant resin. It can be used to provide insights into the terrestrial conditions at the time the original resin was exuded. Amber research thus can inform many aspects of palaeontology, from the recovery and description of enclosed fossil organisms (biological inclusions) to attempts at reconstruction of past climates and environments. Here we focus on the resin itself, the conditions under which it may have been exuded, and its potential path to fossilisation, rather than on enclosed fossils. It is noteworthy that not all plants produce resin, and that not all resins can (nor do) become amber. Given the recent upsurge in the number of amber deposits described, it is time to re-examine ambers from a botanical perspective. Here we summarise the state of knowledge about resin production in modern ecosystems, and review the biological and ecological aspects of resin production in plants. We also present new observations on conifer-derived resin exudation, with a particular focus on araucarian conifer trees. We suggest that besides disease, insect attacks and traumatic wounding from fires and storms, other factors such as tree architecture and local soil conditions are significant in creating and preserving resin outpourings. We also examine the transformation of resin into amber (maturation), focusing on geological aspects of amber deposit formation and preservation. We present new evidence that expands previous understanding of amber deposit formation. Specific geological conditions such as anoxic burial are essential in the creation of amber from resin deposits. We show that in the past, the production of large amounts of resin could have been linked to global climate changes and environmental disruption. We then highlight where the gaps in our knowledge still remain and potential future research directions. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Objective: To assess the antioxidant content, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various propolis samples. Methods: Seven propolis samples were collected from different locations in Morocco, which are characterized by different plant predominant vegetations. The resin, wax and balsam of hydroalcoholic extract of propolis content were identified, and the antioxidant content was analyzed with the use of HPLC and colorimetric methods. The antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH, ABTS.+ and ferric reducing power assays. The antimicrobial activity was assessed against bacterial species, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration. Results: The propolis samples showed significant variations in the chemical composition and in the antioxidant or antimicrobial activities even when the samples were collected from the same location. Propolis with high resin and low wax content had high level of antioxidant compounds, and strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Gram-positive bacteria, especially, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were more sensitive to all propolis samples than Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans. Conclusions: The chemical composition and the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of various propolis samples are different and rely on the geographic and plant origin of propolis collection. Propolis samples with low wax and high resin content might be more suitable to be used in future preclinical or clinical investigations. © 2018 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine.

abstract={Honey is a natural product with very diverse sensory attributes that are influenced by the flower source, the bee species, the geographic origin, the treatments and conditions during storage. This study aimed at describing 50 honeys from diverse flower sources in different continents and islands, stored under various conditions. Many articles have been published on the sensory characterization of honeys, thus a common list of attributes has been established, but it appeared to be poorly suited to describe a large number of honeys from around the world. This is why the novel and rapid sensory evaluation method, the Pivot Profile©, was tested, with the participation of 15 panelists during five sessions. The first objective was to obtain a sensory description of the 50 honeys that were tested. From 1152 distinct terms, a list of 29 sensory attributes was established and the attributes divided into three categories: color/texture (8 terms), aroma (16 terms), and taste (5 terms). At first, the honeys have been ranked according to their level of crystallization from fluid/liquid to viscous/hard. Then color was the second assessment factor of the variability. In terms of aroma, honeys from Africa were characterized by smoky, resin, caramel and dried fruit as opposed to floral and fruity, mainly for honeys from South America and Europe. Finally, the honeys were ranked according to their sweetness. The second objective of this study was to test the new sensory method, called Pivot Profile© which is used to describe a large number of products with interpretable results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={For successful establishment of meliponiculture with Trigona iridipennis Smith, several attributes such as nesting substrates, orientations, elevation, internal characteristics of nests, floral resources, and foraging activity were studied in Bankura district of West Bengal, India. The most commonly found nesting substrate was tree trunks, especially within the cavities in tree trunks of Butea monosperma. Majority of the wild nests were oriented westward direction with an elevation of &gt; 2–≤ 3 m from the ground level. The mean cavity size was 204.3 ± 92.45 × 159 ± 17.59 × 174.5 ± 26.13 mm3. The diversified local angiosperm flora supports the broad polylectic foraging habit of the bee species. Most of the visited plants were of tree habits and had small-sized flowers with yellow, white, and cream colours. The best represented families were Fabaceae and Asteraceae. The plants intensely utilized by the bee species were Acacia auriculiformis, Borassus flabellifer, Brassica nigra, Eucalyptus globulus, and Lannea coromandelica. In contrast to majority of multifloral honey samples, all the pollen loads were unifloral which reflects the high degree of floral fidelity behaviour of the bee species. The foraging activity of the bee species varied according to time hours, plant species, weather conditions, and seasons. It was confined to daytime from 5.00 to 18.00 h, reaching its zenith during 9.00–11.00 h and 15.00–1600 h. Maximum activity was observed in spring, followed by winter, late autumn, summer, autumn, and monsoon. Mean number of foragers without pollen load and resin load was much higher than pollen foragers and resin foragers. © 2017, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).},

abstract={plant-Floral resources are strongly related to the establishment and maintenance of plant-pollinator pollinator interactions. Interacting species have different degrees of dependence, which are defined mainly by the strategies of plants to make available the floral resources and those presented by visitors in collecting these resources. However, morphological and behavioral differences among visitors allow them to assume different roles-beyond the one of pollinators-in interactions with plants. For instance, floral visitors can act as resource thieves or robbers. Thus, plants exhibit different resource distribution strategies while the floral visitors exhibit different foraging strategies to obtain floral resources. We present specific sections on the main floral resources: nectar, pollen, oil, resins and perfumes with the purpose of critically review the literature in order to present: (1) the strategies used by plants to maintain pollinators visiting on flowers without waste floral resources, and (2) the strategies used by the animals to optimize their foraging as a function of the floral resources. The maintenance of the availability of floral resources depends on the maintenance of pollination, which in turn is conditioned to the way visitors behave during the visit in search of floral resources. Therefore, relationships between plants and floral visitors tend to be mutualistic, based relationships even when the individual interests are opposite. In this sense, there is some mutual exploration in which visitors explore resources made available by plants, which in their turn explore the pollination service done by visitors. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

abstract={Effective management of biofilm-related oral infectious diseases is a global challenge. Oral biofilm presents increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and elevated virulence compared with planktonic bacteria. Antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidine, have proven effective in the disruption/inhibition of oral biofilm. However, the challenge of precisely and continuously eliminating the specific pathogens without disturbing the microbial ecology still exists, which is a major factor in determining the virulence of a multispecies microbial consortium and the consequent development of oral infectious diseases. Therefore, several novel approaches are being developed to inhibit biofilm virulence without necessarily inducing microbial dysbiosis of the oral cavity. Nanoparticles, such as pH-responsive enzyme-mimic nanoparticles, have been developed to specifically target the acidic niches within the oral biofilm where tooth demineralization readily occurs, in effect controlling dental caries. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) such as dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM), when incorporated into dental adhesives or resin composite, have also shown excellent and durable antimicrobial activity and thus could effectively inhibit the occurrence of secondary caries. In addition, custom-designed small molecules, natural products and their derivatives, as well as basic amino acids such as arginine, have demonstrated ecological effects by modulating the virulence of the oral biofilm without universally killing the commensal bacteria, indicating a promising approach to the management of oral infectious diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. This article aims to introduce these novel approaches that have shown potential in the control of oral biofilm. These methods may be utilized in the near future to effectively promote the clinical management of oral infectious diseases and thus benefit oral health. © 2018 Xinyi Kuang et al.},

abstract={Honeybees products comprise of numerous substances, including propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly, which have long been known for their medicinal and health-promoting properties. Their wide biological effects have been known and used since antiquity. Bee products are considered to be a potential source of natural antioxidants such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, or terpenoids. Nowadays, the still growing concern in natural substances capable of counteracting the effects of oxidative stress underlying the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, as well as negative effects of different harmful factors and drugs, is being observed. Having regarded the importance of acquiring drugs from natural sources, this review is aimed at updating the current state of knowledge of antioxidant capacity of selected bee products, namely, propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly, and of their potential antioxidant-related therapeutic applications. Moreover, the particular attention has been attributed to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying antioxidant properties of bee products. The influence of bee species, plant origin, geographic location, and seasonality as well as type of extraction solutions on the composition of bee products extracts were also discussed.

abstract={Traditional medicine and ecological cues can both help to reveal bioactive natural compounds. Indigenous Australians have long used kino from trunks of the eucalypt tree, Corymbia citriodora, in traditional medicine. A closely related eucalypt, C. torelliana, produces a fruit resin with antimicrobial properties that is highly attractive to stingless bees. We tested the antimicrobial activity of extracts from kino of C. citriodora, C. torelliana × C. citriodora, and C. torelliana against three Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria and the unicellular fungus, Candida albicans. All extracts were active against all microbes, with the highest activity observed against P. aeruginosa. We tested the activity of seven flavonoids from the kino of C. torelliana against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. All flavonoids were active against P. aeruginosa, and one compound, (+)-(2S)-4″,5,7-trihydroxy-6-methylflavanone, was active against S. aureus. Another compound, 4″,5,7-trihydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone, greatly increased biofilm formation by both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The presence or absence of methyl groups at positions 6 and 8 in the flavonoid A ring determined their anti-Staphylococcus and biofilm-stimulating activity. One of the most abundant and active compounds, 3,4″,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavanone, was tested further against P. aeruginosa and was found to be bacteriostatic at its minimum inhibitory concentration of 200 Μg/mL. This flavanonol reduced adhesion of P. aeruginosa cells while inducing no cytotoxic effects in Vero cells. This study demonstrated the antimicrobial properties of flavonoids in eucalypt kino and highlighted that traditional medicinal knowledge and ecological cues can reveal valuable natural compounds. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Propolis is a complex bioactive mixture produced by bees, known to have different biological activities, especially in countries where there is a rich biodiversity of plant species. The objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition and evaluate the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of Brazilian propolis from the species Plebeia droryana and Apis mellifera found in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. In the ethanolic extracts of P. droryana propolis (ExEP-P) and A. mellifera (ExEP-A) acids, phenolic compounds, terpenes and tocopherol were identified as major compounds. Both extracts presented antioxidant activity against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, the maximum activities being 500 μg/mL (ExEP-P) and 300 μg/mL (ExEP-A). However, only ExEP-A was able to inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by the oxidizing agent 2,2’-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which inhibited oxidative hemolysis and reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in human erythrocytes for 4 h of incubation. The extracts also reduced the cell viability of the K562 erythroleukemia tumour line, with a predominance of necrotic death. Thus, it is concluded that the propolis produced by P. droryana and A. mellifera contain important compounds capable of minimizing the action of oxidizing substances in the organism and reducing the viability of erythroleukemia cells. © 2017 Bonamigo et al.

abstract={Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are constantly dealing with threats from pathogens, pests, pesticides and poor nutrition. It is critically important to understand how honey bees’ natural immune responses (individual immunity) and collective behavioral defenses (social immunity) can improve bee health and productivity. One form of social immunity in honey bee colonies is the collection of antimicrobial plant resins and their use in the nest architecture as propolis. We review research on the constitutive benefits of propolis on the honey bee immune system, and its known therapeutic, colony-level effects against the pathogens Paenibacillus larvae and Ascosphaera apis. We also review the limited research on the effects of propolis against other pathogens, parasites and pests (Nosema, viruses, Varroa destructor, and hive beetles) and how propolis may enhance bee products such as royal jelly and honey. Although propolis may be a source of pesticide contamination, it also has the potential to be a detoxifying agent or primer of detoxification pathways, as well as increasing bee longevity via antioxidant-related pathways. Throughout this paper, we discuss opportunities for future research goals and present ways in which the beekeeping community can promote propolis use in standard colonies, as one way to improve and maintain colony health and resiliency. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Honey bees, Apis mellifera, collect antimicrobial plant resins from the environment and deposit them in their nests as propolis. This behavior is of practical concern to beekeepers since the presence of propolis in the hive has a variety of benefits, including the suppression of disease symptoms. To connect the benefits that bees derive from propolis with particular resinous plants, we determined the identity and botanical origin of propolis compounds active against bee pathogens using bioassay-guided fractionation against the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Eleven dihydroflavonols were isolated from propolis collected in Fallon, NV, including pinobanksin-3-octanoate. This hitherto unknown derivative and five other 3-acyl-dihydroflavonols showed inhibitory activity against both P. larvae (IC50 = 17–68 μM) and Ascosphaera apis (IC50 = 8–23 μM), the fungal agent of chalkbrood. A structure-activity relationship between acyl group size and antimicrobial activity was found, with longer acyl groups increasing activity against P. larvae and shorter acyl groups increasing activity against A. apis. Finally, it was determined that the isolated 3-acyl-dihydroflavonols originated from Populus fremontii, and further analysis showed these compounds can also be found in other North American Populus spp. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Secondary sexual traits may convey reliable information about males’ ability to resist pathogens and that females may prefer those traits because their genes for resistance would be passed on to their offspring. In many insect species, large males have high mating success and can canalize more resources to the immune function than smaller males. In other species, males use pheromones to identify and attract conspecific mates, and thus, they might function as an honest indicator of a male's condition. The males of orchid bees do not produce pheromones. They collect and store flower volatiles, which are mixed with the volatile blends from other sources, like fungi, sap and resins. These blends are displayed as perfumes during the courtship. In this study, we explored the relationship between inter-individual variation in body size and blend composition with the males’ phenoloxidase (PO) content in Euglossa imperialis. PO content is a common measure of insect immune response because melanine, its derived molecule, encapsulates parasites and pathogens. Body size and blend composition were related to bees’ phenolic PO content. The inter-individual variation in body size and tibial contents could indicate differences among males in their skills to gain access to some compounds. The females may evaluate their potential mates through these compounds because some of them are reliable indicators of the males’ capacity to resist infections and parasites. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Numerous studies revealed a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, suggesting that biodiverse environments may not only enhance ecosystem processes, but also benefit individual ecosystem members by, for example, providing a higher diversity of resources. Whether and how the number of available resources affects resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting functions associated with resources) have, however, been little investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated how plant species richness-recorded for study sites located in different habitats-and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality, particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific plant species) become scarce. © 2017 Kaluza et al.},

abstract={Spiders are the most diverse and important terrestrial predators in modern ecosystems. Therefore, fossil spiders are fundamental to understanding past terrestrial ecosystems, especially coevolution with their principal prey, the insects. Being generally soft bodied, spiders have a poor fossil record, but where they do occur, it is in the exceptional circumstance of a Fossil-Lagerstätte. By far the greatest number of fossil spider specimens are found in amber (fossilized tree resin), but earlier than the Cretaceous and outside of amber forest areas, rock-matrix preservation is essential for the spider fossil record. Every taphonomic situation requires a special technique for study. Here, we review imaging techniques in the study of fossil spiders. The earliest depictions of fossil spiders are drawings made with the unaided eye. Light microscopy enabled detailed drawings to be produced and, later, photographs of fossil spiders appeared in the literature. In the 21st century, digital photography has revolutionized image capture and reproduction, and scanning electron microscopy has been applied recently to fossil spiders. The most exciting modern technique, X-ray (including synchrotron source) CT scanning, is now producing extraordinary images of three-dimensional fossil spiders embedded in amber, and the method is also applicable to rock-matrix preservation. We expect to see considerable refinement of these techniques in the future, as well as the possibility of novel ones. Thanks to the excellent preservation of some fossil spiders, and modern techniques available to provide exquisite images of fine morphological details, fossil spiders can now be considered taxonomically (sub)equal to modern forms. Hence, the usual excuse for excluding fossil spiders in phylogenetic and other studies no longer carries as much weight as it once did, and we encourage neontologists to consider the fossil record whenever possible. © 2017},

The botanical origin of propolis was established by comparing propolis spectral data to those of buds of various Populus species. An O2PLS method was utilized to integrate two blocks of data. According to OPLS and O2PLS, the major compounds in propolis samples, collected from temperate continental climate above 500 m, were phenolic glycerides originating from P. tremula buds. Flavonoids were predominant in propolis samples collected below 400 m, originating from P. nigra and P. x euramericana buds.

abstract={Antimalarial drug resistance is the main therapeutic challenge to the control of the disease, making the search for new compounds as alternative treatments of central importance. Propolis has a long history of medicinal use due to its antifungal, antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the antimalarial activity of the Saudi propolis methanolic extract against Plasmodium chabaudi infection in mice. To this end, albino mice were divided into five groups: the first group was the normal control; the second, third, fourth and fifth groups were infected intraperitoneally with 106P. chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes. The last three groups of mice were gavaged with 100 μl of propolis extract (PE) at a dose of 25, 50 and 100 mg PE/kg, respectively, once daily for 7 days. PE significantly suppressed the parasitaemia and showed significant efficacy in ameliorating anaemic conditions in P. chabaudi-infected mice in a dose-dependent manner. Histological investigation of the spleen tissue of treated and untreated mice further supports the antimalarial potential of PE. In addition, our study proved that Saudi PE reduced oxidative damage by decreasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing the catalase (CAT) activity and the glutathione (GSH) levels. Also, Saudi PE increased the level of some pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF and G-CSF, with the most effective dose being 100 mg PE/kg. In conclusion, PE showed antimalarial and antioxidant activities and provided protection against spleen tissue damage in P. chabaudi-infected mice. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of the geopropolis of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides and to evaluate its antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. The composition of the hydroethanolic extract of geopropolis (HEG) included di- and trigalloyl and phenylpropanyl heteroside derivatives, flavanones, diterpenes, and triterpenes. HEG showed antioxidant action via the direct capture of free radicals and by inhibiting the levels of oxidative hemolysis and malondialdehyde in human erythrocytes under oxidative stress. HEG also reduced the frequency of gene conversion and the number of mutant colonies of S. cerevisiae. The anti-inflammatory action of HEG was demonstrated by the inhibition of hyaluronidase enzyme activity. In addition, HEG induced cell death in all evaluated gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts, including clinical isolates with antimicrobial drug resistance. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of M. q. anthidioides geopropolis for the prevention and treatment of various diseases related to oxidative stress, mutagenesis, inflammatory processes, and microbial infections. © 2017 Cintia Miranda dos Santos et al.},

abstract={Geopropolis is a product containing wax, plant resin, and soil particles. It is elaborated by stingless bees of tribe Meliponini. Methanol extracts of sample of geopropolis produced by Scaptotrigona postica ("mandaguari") in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN, northeast Brazil) were analyzed for the determination of standard parameters (total phenols, total flavonoids, and radical scavenging activity) and chemical characterization by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis. The sample analyzed has high contents of total phenols and flavonoids, as well as high antioxidant activity. The constituents characterized were mainly flavonols, such as quercetin methyl ethers, and methoxychalcones. Such chemical profile is similar to the composition of a green propolis from the same area of RN, which is produced by Africanized Apis mellifera, using shoot apices of Mimosa tenuiflora, popularly known as "jurema-preta." This finding provides evidence that "mandaguari" geopropolis and honeybee propolis have the same botanical origin in RN. The sharing of a plant resin source by phylogenetically distant bees (Apinae and Meliponinae) suggests that bee genetic factors play little role in the choice of plants for resin collection and that the availability of potential botanical sources plays a decisive role. © 2017 Joselena M.

abstract={Introduction: Propolis is the substance that protects the hive, a resin of complex and viscous composition bees use in the repair and protection of the hive. The material from which propolis arises are the resins, shoots and petioles of the leaves of different plants, so it has a very complex chemical composition that varies depending on the flora of the bees collection. It offers an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory capacity related to its antioxidant, immunomodulatory power, among others. Aims: In this work, antioxidant and antitumoral activities of different propolis collected from different areas of the province of Malaga, comparing them with one from the Bohemian region to the south of the Czech Republic are studied. Material and methods: Antioxidant activity was determined according to the ABTS+/S2O8K2 method. In addition, the quantity of total proteins from the nitrogen content and subsequently the cytotoxicity and antitumoral activity of the propolis of Puerto de la Torre, north of Malaga, are measured according to the 3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-il)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method. Results: It was observed that propolis has high antioxidant activity, although it has a lower amount of proteins. Propolis has high toxicity and higher antitumoral activity against colon cancer than leukemia. Discussion: With all these data, it can be concluded that propolis offers different activities of interest, for the food and cosmetic industry, among which the high antioxidant and antitumoral capacity.},

abstract={Propolis is a natural mixture of compounds produced by various bee species, including stingless bees. This compound has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antitumor activities. The present study aimed to determine the chemical constituents as well as the antioxidant, cytotoxic, and toxic activities of ethanol extracts of propolis obtained from the stingless bees Scaptotrigona depilis and Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides, which are found in Brazil. Phytosterols, terpenes, phenolic compounds, and tocopherol were identified in the ethanol extracts of propolis (EEPs) in different concentrations. The compounds stigmasterol, taraxasterol, vanilic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin were found only in EEP-M. The EEPs were able to scavenge the free radicals 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and protected human erythrocytes against lipid peroxidation, with the latter effect being demonstrated by their antihemolytic activity and inhibition of malondialdehyde formation. The EEPs showed cytotoxic activity against erythroleukemic cells and necrosis was the main mechanism of death observed. In addition, the concentrations at which the EEPs were cytotoxic were not toxic against Caenorhabditis elegans. In this context, it is concluded that EEP-S and EEP-M show antioxidant and cytotoxic activities and are promising bioactive mixtures for the control of diseases associated with oxidative stress and tumor cell proliferation. © 2017 Thaliny Bonamigo et al.},

abstract={Propolis extracts have shown to possess several health beneficial properties attributed to their phenol composition. Several pharmaceutical formulations are based on propolis as active ingredient and it could also be a potential component of functional foods. The main drawback for its application as food ingredient is its low water solubility, strong taste and aroma. In this work, an encapsulated Argentine alcohol-free propolis powder was obtained by spray drying, by using different maltodextrin matrices, with or without added gums. Besides, physicochemical characterization of powders and biocompound stability studies towards humidification at different water activities were done. Galangin and pinocembrin were the major components identified by HPLC in propolis before and after the drying process. The SEM images analysis showed that the addition of gums improved the particles integrity and size homogeneity. Furthermore, a higher degree of encapsulation of some polyphenols (such as quercetin), higher antioxidant activity measured by the reducing power assay, and higher physical stability toward humidification and physical collapse were also achieved especially in gum-added systems. The use of propolis as an encapsulated powdered additive widens its alcohol-free dosage applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Geopropolis, a mixture of plant resin, wax, soil and salivary secretion, is produced by the stingless bee Melipona fasciculata. This aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of geopropolis collected from beehives in two phytogeographical regions, flooded fields and cerrado, in the municipalities of Palmeirândia and Fernando Falcão, Maranhão State, northeastern Brazil. The geopropolis compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Additionally, total phenolic content was determined with the Folin−Ciocalteu reagent and antioxidant activity was evaluated in vitro by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The four geopropolis samples varied in terms of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity and the highest values were observed for geopropolis from Fernando Falcão. Triterpenes such as cycloartane, ursane and oleanane and phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid and gallic acid) were identified in the geopropolis from Palmeirândia, while the phenolic acids, gallic and ellagic acid were the main compounds in geopropolis from Fernando Falcão. The antioxidant property of geopropolis is due to its high total phenolic content and predominance of gallic acid and ellagic acid. The results showed that the plant resources in two phytogeographical regions of Maranhão used by bees for the production of geopropolis contribute to the chemical composition and bioactivity of this product. © 2016, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

abstract={Honey bees harvest resins from various plant species and use them in the hive as propolis. While there have been a number of studies concerning the chemical composition of this antimicrobial product, little is known about selective behavior and bee preference when different potential plant sources of resin are available. The main objective of this paper was to investigate some aspects of behavioral patterns of honeybees in the context of resin acquisition. Samples of propolis originating from temperate zones of Europe and the supposed botanical precursors of the product were analyzed. Taxonomical markers of bud resins of two white birch species, aspen, black poplar, horse-chestnut, black alder, and Scots pine were determined through GC-MS analysis. All these trees have been reported as sources of propolis, but comparisons of the chemical composition of their bud resins with the compositions of propolis samples from seven European countries have demonstrated the presence of taxonomical markers only from black poplar, aspen, and one species of birch. This suggests selective behavior during the collection of bud resins by honeybees. To examine the causes of such selectivity, the antimicrobial properties of bud resins were determined. Horse-chestnut resins had lower antimicrobial activity than the other resins which did not differ significantly. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Thus, the study of the biological properties of a given sample should always be associated with its chemical composition and botanical source, representing a particular sample of a given geographic area, exploring its biological potential and the role of its constituents. Efforts have been carried out to explain propolis' mechanisms of action in vivo and in vitro, but the majority of propolis' targets and actions are still unclear. The number of formulations containing propolis and patents have increased, although propolis extracts have been used deliberately with different recommendations, not always mentioning the chemical composition, vegetal source and the methods of extraction.

Yet, hive products should chiefly facilitate medication and sanitation of the honeybees themselves rather than other organisms. We here review the impact of both self-produced gland secretions and foraged hive products (pharmacognosy) on colony health. Although foraged plant-derived compounds vary highly in antibiotic activity depending on the floral and regional origins, secondary plant metabolites in honey, pollen and propolis are important for the antibiotic activity against pathogens and parasites. However, specific bee health-enhancing activities of bee products should clearly be distinguished from the effects of an intact nutrition ensuring the basic immune competence of bees. Further unravelling the interactions among groups of active substances or individual compounds used in concert with specific behavioural adaptations will deepen our understanding of the natural potential of honeybees to maintain colony health. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Propolis is a relevant research subject worldwide. However, there is no information so far on Bolivian propolis. Ten propolis samples were collected from regions with high biodiversity in the main honey production places in Bolivia and were analyzed for their total phenolics (TP), flavonoids (TF) and antioxidant activity. The chemical profiles of the samples were assessed by TLC, HPLC-DAD, HPLC-DAD-MS/MSn and NMR analysis. RESULTS: TP, TF, TLC and NMR analysis showed significant chemical differences between the samples. Isolation of the main constituents by chromatography and identification by HPLC-DAD-MS/MSn achieved more than 35 constituents. According to their profiles, the Bolivian propolis can be classified into phenolic-rich and triterpene-rich samples. Propolis from the valleys (Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Tarija) contained mainly prenylated phenylpropanoids, while samples from La Paz and Santa Cruz contained cycloartane and pentacyclic triterpenes. Phenolic-rich samples presented moderate to strong antioxidant activity while the triterpene-rich propolis were weakly active. CONCLUSION: High chemical diversity and differential antioxidant effects were found in Bolivian propolis. Our results provide additional evidence on the chemical composition and bioactivity of South American propolis. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={Increasing human land use for agriculture and housing leads to the loss of natural habitat and to widespread declines in wild bees. Bee foraging dynamics and fitness depend on the availability of resources in the surrounding landscape, but how precisely landscape related resource differences affect bee foraging patterns remains unclear. To investigate how landscape and its interaction with season and weather drive foraging and resource intake in social bees, we experimentally compared foraging activity, the allocation of foragers to different resources (pollen, nectar, and resin) and overall resource intake in the Australian stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria (Apidae, Meliponini). Bee colonies were monitored in different seasons over two years. We compared foraging patterns and resource intake between the bees' natural habitat (forests) and two landscapes differently altered by humans (suburban gardens and agricultural macadamia plantations). We found foraging activity as well as pollen and nectar forager numbers to be highest in suburban gardens, intermediate in forests and low in plantations. Foraging patterns further differed between seasons, but seasonal variations strongly differed between landscapes. Sugar and pollen intake was low in plantations, but contrary with our predictions, it was even higher in gardens than in forests. In contrast, resin intake was similar across landscapes. Consequently, differences in resource availability between natural and altered landscapes strongly affect foraging patterns and thus resource intake in social bees. While agricultural monocultures largely reduce foraging success, suburban gardens can increase resource intake well above rates found in natural habitats of bees, indicating that human activities can both decrease and increase the availability of resources in a landscape and thus reduce or enhance bee fitness. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Chitosan and propolis are natural substances that can be commonly found in the environment. Chitosan is one of the several cationic polysaccharides found in nature. It is a natural biopolymer transformed from chitin which is a product of crustacean shells. Propolis is produced by honeybees through mixing the secretions of their hypopharyngeal glands with the digested product of resins collected from plants. Due to their excellent chemical and biological properties, chitosan and propolis arouse keen interest in dental science, including endodontics. There are various possibilities for applying propolis and chitosan based medicaments in endodontic treatment of root canals, and what is particularly emphasized is their potential effectiveness against resistant microorganisms such as E. faecalis and C. albicans, as well as biocompatible to the periapical tissues in comparison with the most commonly used agents. They aim at microflora which is difficult to eliminate, and their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antiseptic properties, make them suitable for use in endodontic treatment. Due to the potential side effects of commonly used synthetic drugs and other safety related reasons, natural alternatives for endodontic usage are continuously explored and tested. The paper presents the possibilities of applying propolis and chitosan in endodontic treatment on the basis of chosen articles published in recent years. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Total phenolic compounds were quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu and antioxidant properties were assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus. Correlation and multivariate statistical analysis were used to identify potential bioactive compounds in the extracts. Twenty-nine metabolites were identified along with 34 other metabolites that were classified into the following classes: triterpenoids (12), acetyltriterpenoids (3), sesquiterpenes (6), steroids (4), and hydrocarbons (9). The antioxidant capacity (IC50) ranged from 21.50 to 78.77μg/mL, whereas the content of total phenolic compounds ranged from 31.88 to 204.30mg GAE/g of dry weight. Total phenolic compounds and methyl retinoate showed a positive correlation with the antioxidant capacity, whereas tetradecanal, γ-palmitolactone and ethyl hydrocinnamate showed a negative correlation. Different sets of metabolites are shown to correlate with the antibacterial activity of the extracts, which is largely dependent on the type of microorganism. This innovative approach allowed us to identify likely bioactive compounds in the extracts, although the mechanism(s) underlying antibacterial activity encompass a complex trait, which might involve synergistic effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Aims: This study reports on the inhibitory and bactericidal properties of 39 South African (SA) propolis samples and three propolis samples from Brazil. Methods and Results: Ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared and their antimicrobial activities tested using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. Some samples displayed substantial antimicrobial activity with MIC and MBC values as low as 6 μg ml-1 against Staphylococcus aureus. The correlation between liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) chemical data and the antimicrobial activity of propolis extracts was investigated using multivariate data analysis tools. Orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) models were created for the two Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus) and Candida albicans. Using the S-plot function, it was possible to identify the bioactive constituents in propolis as chrysin, pinocembrin, galangin and pinobanksin-3-O-acetate. Conclusion: The SA propolis samples tested displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, favourably comparable to that of the Brazilian comparator and 'gold standard'. The observed antimicrobial activity of SA propolis can possibly be attributed to its flavonoid content. Significance and Impact of the Study: Based on the good antimicrobial activity observed for SA propolis, this natural resource shows promise and should be considered for development which may contribute to growing the bio-economy in the region. © 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract={Amber from the Campo La Granja mine in Chiapas, Mexico, is distinct from other sources of amber in Chiapas. Campo La Granja amber has distinct layers created by successive flows of resin with thin layers of sand on most surfaces. Aquatic and semi-aquatic arthropods are commonly found. Together these pieces of evidence suggest an estuarine environment similar to modern mangrove communities. The aquatic crustaceans are the most intriguing aspect of the biota. A large number of ostracods have been found in the amber-many with their carapaces open, suggesting that they were alive and submerged in water at the time of entombment. The only known examples of brachyuran crabs preserved in amber are found in the Campo La Granja amber. Amphipods, copepods, isopods, and tanaids are also members of the crustacean fauna preserved in amber. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Tree invasions have substantial impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and trees that are dispersed by animals are more likely to become invasive. In addition, hybridisation between plants is well documented as a source of new weeds, as hybrids gain new characteristics that allow them to become invasive. Corymbia torelliana is an invasive tree with an unusual animal dispersal mechanism: seed dispersal by stingless bees, that hybridizes readily with other species. We examined hybrids between C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora to determine whether hybrids have inherited the seed dispersal characteristics of C. torelliana that allow bee dispersal. Some hybrid fruits displayed the characteristic hollowness, resin production and resin chemistry associated with seed dispersal by bees. However, we did not observe bees foraging on any hybrid fruits until they had been damaged. We conclude that C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora hybrids can inherit some fruit characters that are associated with dispersal by bees, but we did not find a hybrid with the complete set of characters that would enable bee dispersal. However, around 20,000 hybrids have been planted in Australia, and ongoing monitoring is necessary to identify any hybrids that may become invasive. © 2015 Wallace, Leonhardt.},

abstract={Propolis is a material manufactured by bees and contains beeswax, bee salivary secretions and plant resins. Propolis preparations have been used for millennia by humans in food, cosmetics and medicines due to its antibacterial effects. Within the hive, propolis plays an important role in bees’ health, with much of its bioactivity largely dependent on the plant resins the bees select for its production. Few chemical studies are available on the chemistry of propolis produced by Australian honeybees (Apis mellifera, Apidae). This study aimed to determine the chemical composition as well as in vitro antimicrobial effects of propolis harvested from honeybees in subtropical eastern Australia. Honeybee propolis was produced using plastic frames and multiple beehives in two subtropical sites in eastern Australia. Methanolic extracts of propolis were analysed by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry (ultra- high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-UV-highresolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS)) and by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The resulting chemical data were dereplicated for compound characterisation. The two crude extracts in abs. ethanol were tested in vitro by the agar diffusion and broth dilution methods, using a phenol standard solution as the positive control and abs. ethanol as the negative control. Chemical constituents were identified to be pentacyclic triterpenoids and Cprenylated flavonoids, including Abyssinoflavanone VII, Propolin C and Nymphaeol C. The two propolis crude extracts showed bactericidal effects at the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.37–2.04 mg mL−1against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. However, the extracts were inactive against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The antistaphylococcal potential of propolis was discussed, also in relation to honeybees’ health, as it warrants further investigations on the social and individual immunities of Australian honeybees. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Propolis is a substance derived from antimicrobial plant resins that honey bees use in the construction of their nests. Propolis use in the hive is an important component of honey bee social immunity and confers a number of positive physiological benefits to bees. The benefits that bees derive from resins are mostly due to their antimicrobial properties, but it is unknown how the diversity of antimicrobial activities among resins might impact bee health. In our previous work, we found that resins from different North American Populus spp. differed in their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of the bee bacterial pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. The goal of our current work was to characterize the antimicrobial activity of propolis from 12 climatically diverse regions across the US against the bee pathogens P. larvae and Ascosphaera apis and compare the metabolite profiles among those samples using LC-MS-based metabolomic methods. Samples differed greatly in their ability to inhibit both bacterial and fungal growth in vitro, but propolis from Nevada, Texas, and California displayed high activity against both pathogens. Interestingly, propolis from Georgia, New York, Louisiana, and Minnesota were active against A. apis, but not very active against P. larvae. Metabolomic analysis of regional propolis samples revealed that each sample was compositionally distinct, and LC-FTMS profiles from each sample contained a unique number of shared and exclusive peaks. Propolis from Aspen, CO, Tuscon, AZ, and Raleigh, NC, contained relatively large numbers of exclusive peaks, which may indicate that these samples originated from relatively unique botanical sources. This is the first study to characterize how the diversity of bee preferred resinous plants in the US may affect bee health, and could guide future studies on the therapeutic potential of propolis for bees. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Previously, stingless bee (Trigona spp.) products from East Kalimantan, Indonesia, were successfully screened for in vitro antiproliferative activity against human cancer derived cell lines. It was established that propolis from T. incisa presented the highest in vitro cytotoxicity against the SW620 colon cancer cell line (6% cell survival in 20 μg/mL). Materials and Methods: Propolis from T. incisa was extracted with methanol and further partitioned with n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed by the MTT assay against human colon (SW620), liver (Hep-G2), gastric (KATO-III), lung (Chago) and breast (BT474) cancer derived cell lines. The active fractions were further enriched by silica gel quick column, absorption and size exclusion chromatography. The purity of each fraction was checked by thin layer chromatography. Cytotoxicity in BT-474 cells induced by cardanol compared to doxorubicin were evaluated by MTT assay, induction of cell cycle arrest and cell death by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide and annexin-V stained cells. Results: A cardol isomer was found to be the major compound in one active fraction (F45) of T. incisa propolis, with a cytotoxicity against the SW620 (IC50 of 4.51 ± 0.76 μg/mL), KATO-III (IC50 of 6.06 ± 0.39 μg/mL), Hep-G2 (IC50 of 0.71 ± 0.22 μg/mL), Chago I (IC50 of 0.81 ± 0.18 μg/mL) and BT474 (IC50 of 4.28 ± 0.14 μg/mL) cell lines. Early apoptosis (programmed cell death) of SW620 cells was induced by the cardol containing F45 fraction at the IC50 and IC80 concentrations, respectively, within 2-6 h of incubation. In addition, the F45 fraction induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 subphase. Conclusions: Indonesian stingless bee (T. incisa) propolis had moderately potent in vitro anticancer activity on human cancer derived cell lines. Cardol or 5-pentadecyl resorcinol was identified as a major active compound and induced apoptosis in SW620 cells in an early period (≤ 6 h) and cell cycle arrest at the G1 subphase. Thus, cardol is a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy.},

abstract={Propolis from stingless bees Tetragonisca fiebrigi found in Brazil is used in folk medicine by their nutritional and therapeutic properties. However, there are no scientific records evidencing such properties. The present study was designed to investigate the chemical composition and the biological properties of propolis from T. fiebrigi. For this, the chemical composition of the ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) was determined by GC-MS and presented phenolic compounds, alcohol, and terpenes as its major class compounds. The antimicrobial activity was accessed in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and in fungi, isolated from different biological fluids and reference strains. The EEP was active against all microorganisms and showed antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting hemolysis and lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes incubated with an oxidizing agent. The anti-inflammatory potential of the EEP was confirmed by inhibition of the hyaluronidase enzyme. The cytotoxic activity was concentration-dependent against K562 cells, with a predominance of death by necrosis. Taken together, these results show that propolis from T. fiebrigi has important therapeutic activities, which suggest its potential application in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as in health foods, beverages, and nutritional supplements. © 2015 Jaqueline Ferreira Campos et al.},

Total polyphenol content of the Chennai sample is 10 μg/ml of Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and the flavonoid content is 48μg /ml of Quercetin equivalent (QE). This is very low when compared to the pudukottai sample, total poly phenol of which is 150μg/ml of Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and the flavonoid content is 6mg/g of Quercetin equivalent (QE).

abstract={Despite the loss of the sting apparatus, Meliponini (stingless) bees have not lost their ability to defend themselves. Several defensive strategies have been described for the group, including biting and resin deposition. Defensive behavior can be mediated by chemical communication, for example through the use of alarm pheromones. The Stingless bee species Melipona flavolineata Friese is an important species for meliponiculture in Brazil, especially in the Amazon region. In order to improve the current management methods for the species, this study aimed to describe the range of defensive strategies used by the stingless bee M. flavolineata towards inter and intraspecific chemical signals known to trigger defensive responses in related species, namely the head secretions of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao (Smith) and the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers. The stimuli provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions of the robber bee repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and the agglomeration of workers outside the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract elicited aggression towards the pheromone deposition site, transport of resin and generalised agitated flights. Our results confirm the role of the mandibular gland as a source of alarm pheromone in this species and the chemical triggering of a specific defensive response to the known cleptoparasite L. limao.},

abstract={Honey bee hives are filled with stored pollen, honey, plant resins and wax, all antimicrobial to differing degrees. Stored pollen is the nutritionally rich currency used for colony growth and consists of 40-50% simple sugars. Many studies speculate that prior to consumption by bees, stored pollen undergoes long-term nutrient conversion, becoming more nutritious 'bee bread' as microbes predigest the pollen. We quantified both structural and functional aspects associated with this hypothesis using behavioural assays, bacterial plate counts, microscopy and 454 amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from both newly collected and hive-stored pollen. We found that bees preferentially consume fresh pollen stored for <3 days. Newly collected pollen contained few bacteria, values which decreased significantly as pollen were stored >96 h. The estimated microbe to pollen grain surface area ratio was 1:1 000 000 indicating a negligible effect of microbial metabolism on hive-stored pollen. Consistent with these findings, hive-stored pollen grains did not appear compromised according to microscopy. Based on year round 454 amplicon sequencing, bacterial communities of newly collected and hive-stored pollen did not differ, indicating the lack of an emergent microbial community co-evolved to digest stored pollen. In accord with previous culturing and 16S cloning, acid resistant and osmotolerant bacteria like Lactobacillus kunkeei were found in greatest abundance in stored pollen, consistent with the harsh character of this microenvironment. We conclude that stored pollen is not evolved for microbially mediated nutrient conversion, but is a preservative environment due primarily to added honey, nectar, bee secretions and properties of pollen itself. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Biodiverse environments provide a variety of resources that can be exploited by consumers. While many studies revealed a positive correlation between biodiversity and consumer biomass and richness, only few studies have investigated how resource diversity affects single consumers. To better understand whether a single consumer species benefits from diverse resources, we tested how the protective function of a defensive plant resource (i.e. resin exploited by social bees) varied among different sources and target organisms (predators, parasites and pathogens). To assess synergistic effects, resins from different plant genera were tested separately and in combination. We found that resin diversity is beneficial for bees, with its functional properties depending on the target organisms, type and composition of resin. Different resins showed different effects, and mixtures were more effective than some of the single resins (functional complementarity). We conclude that resins of different plant species target different organisms and act synergistically where combined. Bees that rely on resin for protection benefit more when they have access to diverse resin sources. Loss of biodiversity may in turn destabilize consumer populations due to restricted access to a variety of resources. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many insect groups are important mutualistic partners of plants. Bees in particular provide an essential mutualistic service to plants: pollination of their flowers. They can also act as seed dispersers for plants, a rare seed dispersal mutualism termed melittochory. One group of known bee seed dispersers are stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini). Australian stingless bees collect resin from fruits of the eucalypt tree Corymbia torelliana (Myrtaceae). In doing so, they disperse the trees' seeds. Therefore, the resin chemistry of C. torelliana may be particularly well adapted to attract the bees. While the importance of visual and olfactory cues has been frequently studied in pollination mutualisms, we here provide the first study to investigate the importance of resin compounds as olfactory cues in a bee seed dispersal mutualism. To investigate whether the seed-dispersing Australian stingless bee species Tetragonula carbonaria relies on olfactory cues when searching for C. torelliana resin and which compounds of the blend they use to identify it, we performed several choice tests with pure resin extracts, fractionated extracts, extracts enriched with C. torelliana resin compounds and with single compounds. Olfactory cues were sufficient to attract bees, confirming the importance of olfactory cues for resin-searching stingless bees. However, bees only landed on filter papers with pure resin extract, but not on fractionated or enriched extracts, nor on single compounds. This finding indicates that, instead of relying on just a few specific volatile compounds, the bees used a complex blend as recognition cue including relative compound proportions. Moreover, they showed little tolerance for even slight concentration changes of single components. Such high cue specificity is rather unusual for insects seeking resources, but does, in the case of Australian stingless bees, ensure detection and identification of the resin of their mutualistic partner. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Propolis is a sticky material collected by bees from plants, and used in the hive as building material and defensive substance. It has been popular as a remedy in Europe since ancient times. Nowadays, propolis use in over-the-counter preparations, " bio" -cosmetics and functional foods, etc., increases. Volatile compounds are found in low concentrations in propolis, but their aroma and significant biological activity make them important for propolis characterisation. Propolis is a plant-derived product: its chemical composition depends on the local flora at the site of collection, thus it offers a significant chemical diversity. The role of propolis volatiles in identification of its plant origin is discussed. The available data about chemical composition of propolis volatiles from different geographic regions are reviewed, demonstrating significant chemical variability. The contribution of volatiles and their constituents to the biological activities of propolis is considered. Future perspectives in research on propolis volatiles are outlined, especially in studying activities other than antimicrobial. © 2014 Bankova et al.; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

The chemical composition of the ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) indicated the presence of aromatic acids, phenolic compounds, alcohols, terpenes and sugars. The EEP was active against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the fungus Candida albicans. The EEP showed antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting hemolysis and lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes incubated with an oxidizing agent. Additionally, EEP promoted cytotoxic activity and primarily necrotic death in K562 erythroleukemia cells.

abstract={Background: Propolis is a sticky, dark brown resinous residue made by bees that is derived from plant resins. It is used to construct and repair the nest, and in addition possesses several diverse bioactivities. Here, propolis from Apis mellifera from Nan province, Thailand, was tested for antibacterial activity against Gram+ve (Staphylococcus aureus and Paenibacillus larvae) and Gram-ve (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Materials and methods: The three bacterial isolates were confirmed for species designation by Gram staining and analysis of the partial sequence of 16S rDNA. Propolis was sequentially extracted by methanol, dichloromethane and hexane. The antibacterial activity was determined by agar well diffusion and microbroth dilution assays using streptomycin as a positive control. The most active crude extract was further purified by quick column and adsorption chromatography. The apparent purity of each bioactive fraction was tested by thin layer chromatography. The chemical structure of the isolated bioactive compound was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Results: Crude methanol extract of propolis showed the best antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) value of 5 mg/mL for S. aureus and E. coli and 6.25 mg/mL for P. larvae. After quick column chromatography, only three active fractions were inhibitory to the growth of S. aureus and E. coli with MIC values of 6.25 and 31.3 μg/mL, respectively. Further adsorption chromatography yielded one pure bioactive fraction (A1A) with an IC50 value of 0.175 μg/mL for E. coli and 0.683 μg/mL for P. larvae, and was determined to be cardanol by NMR analysis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed unusual shaped (especially in dividing cells), damaged and dead cells in cardanol-treated E. coli. Conclusion: Thai propolis contains a promising antibacterial agent. © Ivyspring International Publisher.},

abstract={Bee propolis is a mixture of plant resins and bee secretions. While bioactivity of honeybee propolis has been reported previously, information is limited on propolis from Australian stingless bees (Tetragonula carbonaria). The aim of this study was to investigate possible vasomodulatory effects of propolis in KCl-precontracted porcine coronary arteries using an ex vivo tissue bath assay. Polar extracts of propolis produced a dose-dependent relaxant response (EC50=44.7±7.0 μg/ml), which was unaffected by endothelial denudation, suggesting a direct effect on smooth muscle. Propolis markedly attenuated a contractile response to Ca2+ in vessels that were depolarised with 60 mM KCl, in Ca2+-free Krebs solution. Propolis (160 μg/ml) reduced vascular tone in KCl pre-contracted vessels to near-baseline levels over 90 min, and this effect was partially reversible with 6h washout. Some loss in membrane integrity, but no loss in mitochondrial function was detected after 90 min exposure of human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells to 160 μg/ml propolis. We conclude that Australian stingless bee (T. carbonaria) propolis relaxes porcine coronary artery in an endothelial-independent manner that involves inhibition of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels. This effect is partially and slowly reversible upon washout. Further studies are required to determine the therapeutic potential of Australian stingless bee propolis for conditions in which vascular supply is compromised. © 2013 Massaro et al.},

abstract={The deposition of antimicrobial plant resins in honey bee, Apis mellifera, nests has important physiological benefits. Resin foraging is difficult to approach experimentally because resin composition is highly variable among and between plant families, the environmental and plant-genotypic effects on resins are unknown, and resin foragers are relatively rare and often forage in unobservable tree canopies. Subsequently, little is known about the botanical origins of resins in many regions or the benefits of specific resins to bees. We used metabolomic methods as a type of environmental forensics to track individual resin forager behavior through comparisons of global resin metabolite patterns. The resin from the corbiculae of a single bee was sufficient to identify that resin's botanical source without prior knowledge of resin composition. Bees from our apiary discriminately foraged for resin from eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and balsam poplar (P. balsamifera) among many available, even closely related, resinous plants. Cottonwood and balsam poplar resin composition did not show significant seasonal or regional changes in composition. Metabolomic analysis of resin from 6 North American Populus spp. and 5 hybrids revealed peaks characteristic to taxonomic nodes within Populus, while antimicrobial analysis revealed that resin from different species varied in inhibition of the bee bacterial pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae. We conclude that honey bees make discrete choices among many resinous plant species, even among closely related species. Bees also maintained fidelity to a single source during a foraging trip. Furthermore, the differential inhibition of P. larvae by Populus spp., thought to be preferential for resin collection in temperate regions, suggests that resins from closely related plant species many have different benefits to bees. © 2013 Wilson et al.},

abstract={Chemical compounds are highly important in the ecology of animals. In social insects, compounds on the body surface represent a particularly interesting trait, because they comprise different compound classes that are involved in different functions, such as communication, recognition and protection, all of which can be differentially affected by evolutionary processes. Here, we investigate the widely unknown and possibly antagonistic influence of phylogenetic and environmental factors on the composition of the cuticular chemistry of tropical stingless bees. We chose stingless bees because some species are unique in expressing not only self-produced compounds, but also compounds that are taken up from the environment. By relating the cuticular chemistry of 40 bee species from all over the world to their molecular phylogeny and geographical occurrence, we found that distribution patterns of different groups of compounds were differentially affected by genetic relatedness and biogeography. The ability to acquire environmental compounds was, for example, highly correlated with the bees' phylogeny and predominated in evolutionarily derived species. Owing to the presence of environmentally derived compounds, those species further expressed a higher chemical and thus functional diversity. In Old World species, chemical similarity of both environmentally derived and self-produced compounds was particularly high among sympatric species, even when they were less related to each other than to allopatric species, revealing a strong environmental effect even on largely genetically determined compounds. Thus, our findings do not only reveal an unexpectedly strong influence of the environment on the cuticular chemistry of stingless bees, but also demonstrate that even within one morphological trait (an insect's cuticular profile), different components (compound classes) can be differentially affected by different drivers (relatedness and biogeography), depending on the functional context. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: Geopropolis is a type of propolis containing resin, wax, and soil, collected by threatened stingless bee species native to tropical countries and used in folk medicine. However, studies concerning the biological activity and chemical composition of geopropolis are scarce. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of the ethanolic extract of geopropolis (EEGP) collected by Melipona scutellaris and its bioactive fraction against important clinical microorganisms as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity and chemical profile.Methods: The antimicrobial activity of EEGP and fractions was examined by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against six bacteria strains as well as their ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans biofilm adherence. Total growth inhibition (TGI) was chosen to assay the antiproliferative activity of EEGP and its bioactive fraction against normal and cancer cell lines. The chemical composition of M. scutellaris geopropolis was identified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Results: EEGP significantly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus strains and S. mutans at low concentrations, and its hexane fraction (HF) presented the highest antibacterial activity. Also, both EEGP and HF inhibited S. mutans biofilm adherence (p < 0.05) and showed selectivity against human cancer cell lines, although only HF demonstrated selectivity at low concentrations. The chemical analyses performed suggest the absence of flavonoids and the presence of benzophenones as geopropolis major compounds.Conclusions: The empirical use of this unique type of geopropolis by folk medicine practitioners was confirmed in the present study, since it showed antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential against the cancer cell lines studied. It is possible that the major compounds found in this type of geopropolis are responsible for its properties. © 2013 da Cunha et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Flowers of most species formerly included in Maxillaria are rewardless. Some, however, reward pollinators with nectar or pseudopollen, whereas the labella of a relatively small number of taxa produce lipoidal floral rewards that include resins and waxes. To date, the labellar secretory tissues of few species have been examined in detail, and some rewardless species having glossy labella are thought to mimic taxa that produce lipoidal rewards. Here, the labellar anatomy of a range of resin-secreting, wax-secreting and putative resin-mimic species is compared using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry, in order to investigate how such secretory tissues may have evolved. Comparisons are also made with other resiniferous and wax-secreting Maxillariinae s.s., and with rewardless control species and the oil-secreting elaiophores of certain Oncidiinae. The labella of all Maxillariinae species investigated displayed similar anatomy, the differences largely being restricted to the adaxial epidermis and subepidermal layer. The labellar secretory epidermis of resiniferous Maxillariella elatior was composed of epithelial palisade cells, whereas that of other resin- and wax-secreting species investigated consisted of secretory papillae or trichomes. Putative resin-mimic species also produced resin, albeit in small quantities, and, here, the epidermal cells were cuboidal or rectangular in section. Secreted material on the labellar surface of control species was probably fragrance residues. Resin was often heterogeneous, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that its composition could change throughout the course of anthesis. Although the resiniferous floral tissues of Maxillariinae s.s. may be epithelial or trichomal, and thus closely resemble the epithelial and trichomal elaiophores of oil-secreting Oncidiinae, they differ in a number of important ways, necessitating the use of more exact descriptive terminology when distinguishing between oil-, resin- and wax-secreting floral structures. Similarity between the resin- or wax-secreting floral structures of Maxillariinae s.s and the oil-secreting elaiophores of Oncidiinae is probably a result of parallelism. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Origin Osmany Cuesta-Rubio,1,2 Anna Lisa Piccinelli 2 Propolis is a resinous hive product that honey bees produce using parts of plants as buds, leaves, exudates or resins, and beeswax. Propolis has a pleasant aromatic smell and varies in color depending on its source and age. Its chemical composition is highly variable and depends greatly on the plants found around the hive. This characteristic determines a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-infl ammatory, anesthetic, antioxidant and antitumoral properties. Propolis originating from temperate zones (West Asia, Europe, and North America) has a similar chemical composition, the main constituents being phenolic compounds (fl avonoids, cinnamic acids, and derivatives). In these regions, exudates of different poplar buds (Populus species) are the main sources of propolis, together with other trees, birch (Betula alba L.), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), alder (Alnus glutinosa Medik.), and various conifers (Bankova et al. 2000, Castaldo and Capasso 2002). © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Recent research has shown that entrance guards of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula make less errors in distinguishing nestmates from non-nestmates than all other bee species studied to date, but how they achieve this is unknown. We performed four experiments to investigate nestmate recognition by entrance guards in T. angustula. We first investigated the effect of colony odours on acceptance. Nestmates that acquired odour from non-nestmate workers were 63% more likely to be rejected while the acceptance rate of non-nestmates treated with nestmate odour increased by only 7%. We further hypothesised that guards standing on the wax entrance tube might use the tube as an odour referent. However, our findings showed that there was no difference in the acceptance of non-nestmates by guards standing on their own colony's entrance tube versus the non-nestmate's entrance tube. Moreover, treatment of bees with nestmate and non-nestmate resin or wax had a negative effect on acceptance rates of up to 65%, regardless of the origin of the wax or resin. The role of resin as a source of recognition cues was further investigated by unidirectionally transferring resin stores between colonies. Acceptance rates of nestmates declined by 37% for hives that donated resin, contrasting with resin donor hives where acceptance of non-nestmates increased by 21%. Overall, our results confirm the accuracy of nestmate recognition in T. angustula and reject the hypothesis that this high level of accuracy is due to the use of the wax entrance tubes as a referent for colony odour. Our findings also suggest that odours directly acquired from resin serve no primary function as nestmate recognition cues. The lack of consistency among colonies plus the complex results of the third and fourth experiments highlight the need for further research on the role of nest materials and cuticular profiles in understanding nestmate recognition in T. angustula. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background and AimsMolecular evidence indicates that the Neotropical sub-tribe Zygopetalinae is sister to Maxillariinae. Most members of the latter sub-tribe have deceit pollination strategies, but some species produce rewards such as nectar, pseudopollen, resin and wax, and are pollinated by a range of pollinators that include stingless bees (Meliponini), wasps and hummingbirds. By contrast, relatively little is known about the pollination of Zygopetalinae species. However, some are pollinated by fragrance-gathering, male euglossine bees or employ nectar deceit strategies. The aim of this study is to describe the labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae and to compare it with that of Maxillariinae sensu lato (s.l.) as part of an ongoing project to record the range of labellar characters found within the tribe Maxillarieae, and to assess whether these characters represent synapomorphies or homoplasies resulting from similar pollination pressures.MethodsThe labella of 31 species of Zygopetalinae, including Cryptarrhena R. Br. and representatives of the Zygopetalum, Huntleya and Warrea clades, were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the range of labellar characters was recorded. These characters were subsequently compared with those of Maxillariinae s.l. which formed the subject of our previous investigations.Key Results and ConclusionsThe labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae is less diverse than that of Maxillariinae and does not reflect the currently accepted phylogeny of the former sub-tribe based on molecular studies. Instead, the relative uniformity in labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae is probably due to homoplasies resulting from similar pollinator pressures. Labellar trichomes are relatively uncommon in Zygopetalinae, but occur in certain members of both the Zygopetalum and Huntleya clades. Trichomes are unbranched, uniseriate and multicellular with rounded apices, or unbranched and unicellular, with tapering, pointed and flexuose apices. Hitherto, unicellular trichomes of this kind have been observed only for euglossophilous orchid taxa, and the adoption of a relatively limited range of pollination strategies by Zygopetalinae may have resulted in reduced investment in micromorphological labellar characters. © The Author 2011.},

abstract={The diversity of species is striking, but can be far exceeded by the chemical diversity of compounds collected, produced or used by them. Here, we relate the specificity of plant-consumer interactions to chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both levels. Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between tropical stingless bees and plant resins, which bees collect for nest construction and to deter predators and microbes. Resins also function as an environmental source for terpenes that serve as appeasement allomones and protection against predators when accumulated on the bees' body surfaces. To unravel the origin of the bees' complex chemical profiles, we investigated resin collection and the processing of resin-derived terpenes. We therefore analyzed chemical networks of tree resins, foraging networks of resin collecting bees, and their acquired chemical networks. We revealed that 113 terpenes in nests of six bee species and 83 on their body surfaces comprised a subset of the 1,117 compounds found in resins from seven tree species. Sesquiterpenes were the most variable class of terpenes. Albeit widely present in tree resins, they were only found on the body surface of some species, but entirely lacking in others. Moreover, whereas the nest profile of Tetragonula melanocephala contained sesquiterpenes, its surface profile did not. Stingless bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among resin sources, and only a hitherto undescribed species-specific "filtering" of resin-derived terpenes can explain the variation in chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different species. The tight relationship between bees and tree resins of a large variety of species elucidates why the bees' surfaces contain a much higher chemodiversity than other hymenopterans. © 2011 Leonhardt et al.},

abstract={Cerumen, or propolis, is a mixture of plant resins enriched with bee secretions. In Australia, stingless bees are important pollinators that use cerumen for nest construction and possibly for colony's health. While extensive research attests to the therapeutic properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) propolis, the biological and medicinal properties of Australian stingless bee cerumen are largely unknown. In this study, the chemical and biological properties of polar extracts of cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria in South East Queensland, Australia were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses and in vitro 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cell-free assays. Extracts were tested against comparative (commercial tincture of A. mellifera propolis) and positive controls (Trolox and gallic acid). Distinct GC-MS fingerprints of a mixed diterpenic profile typical of native bee cerumen were obtained with pimaric acid (6.31±0.97%, w/w), isopimaric acid (12.23±3.03%, w/w), and gallic acid (5.79±0.81%, w/w) tentatively identified as useful chemical markers. Characteristic flavonoids and prenylated phenolics found in honeybee propolis were absent. Cerumen extracts from T. carbonaria inhibited activity of 5-LOX, an enzyme known to catalyse production of proinflammatory mediators (IC50 19.97±2.67 μg/ml, mean±SEM, n=4). Extracts had similar potency to Trolox (IC50 12.78±1.82 μg/ml), but were less potent than honeybee propolis (IC50 5.90±0.62 μg/ml) or gallic acid (IC50 5.62±0.35 μg/ml, P&lt;0.001). These findings warrant further investigation of the ecological and medicinal properties of this stingless bee cerumen, which may herald a commercial potential for the Australian beekeeping industry. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are the most diverse group of Apid bees and represent common pollinators in tropical ecosystems. Like honeybees they live in large eusocial colonies and rely on complex chemical recognition and communication systems. In contrast to honeybees, their ecology and especially their chemical ecology have received only little attention, particularly in the Old World. We previously have analyzed the chemical profiles of six paleotropical stingless bee species from Borneo and revealed the presence of species-specific cuticular terpenes- an environmentally derived compound class so far unique among social insects. Here, we compared the bees' surface profiles to the chemistry of their nest material. Terpenes, alkanes, and alkenes were the dominant compound groups on both body surfaces and nest material. However, bee profiles and nests strongly differed in their chemical composition. Body surfaces thus did not merely mirror nests, rendering a passive compound transfer from nests to bees unlikely. The difference between nests and bees was particularly pronounced when all resin-derived compounds (terpenes) were excluded and only genetically determined compounds were considered. When terpenes were included, bee profiles and nest material still differed, because whole groups of terpenes (e. g., sesquiterpenes) were found in nest material of some species, but missing in their chemical profile, indicating that bees are able to influence the terpene composition both in their nests and on their surfaces. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Tropical stingless bees additionally collect large amounts of plant resins for nest construction, nest maintenance, nest defense, and to derive chemical constituents for their cuticular profiles. We here demonstrate that stingless bees of Borneo also use olfactory cues to find tree resins. They rely on volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes to locate or recognize known resin sources. Moreover, by modifying resin extracts, we found that stingless bees do not use the entire resin bouquet but relative proportions of several terpenes. In doing so, the bees are able to learn specific tree resin profiles and distinguish between tree species and partly even tree individuals. © The Author 2010. The Author 2010.

abstract={Social immunity, which describes how individual behaviors of group members effectively reduce disease and parasite transmission at the colony level, is an emerging field in social insect biology. An understudied, but significant behavioral disease resistance mechanism in honey bees is their collection and use of plant resins. Honey bees harvest resins with antimicrobial properties from various plant species and bring them back to the colony where they are then mixed with varying amounts of wax and utilized as propolis. Propolis is an apicultural term for the resins when used by bees within a hive. While numerous studies have investigated the chemical components of propolis that could be used to treat human diseases, there is a lack of information on the importance of propolis in regards to bee health. This review serves to provide a compilation of recent research concerning the behavior of bees in relation to resins and propolis, focusing more on the bees themselves and the potential evolutionary benefits of resin collection. Future research goals are also established in order to create a new focus within the literature on the natural history of resin use among the social insects and role that propolis plays in disease resistance. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.},

To reveal factors that influence the bees' decision about where and when to collect resin, resin collection was studied in ten stingless bee species (Apidae, Meliponini) collecting resin at natural and artificially induced wounds of nine tree species in Borneo. Artificially induced wounds were found by bees within 1-2 d. The number of foragers at artificial wounds increased during the subsequent 5 d until resin secretion stopped or the resin hardened. At natural resin wounds, species identity and number of foragers remained constant during the observation period. Bees collected resin from some trees and ignored others. Agathis borneensis (Araucariaceae) was the most attractive resin source. The bees' visitation rate did not correlate significantly with resin wound size. Inter- and intraspecific aggression occurred at ten resin wounds. In Tetragonilla collina and Tetragonula melanocephala, we additionally recorded resin intake at colony entrances. The proportion of workers retuning with resin varied considerably between colonies. We observed attacks by ants at three of our eight focal colonies, which resulted in a significant increase in resin intake while the nest was under attack and until 1-2 d after the attack had stopped. The increase in resin collection triggered by ant attacks was even stronger than the increase following a manual destruction of the nest entrance tube. © 2009 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Propolis is a natural substance produced by honeybees upon collection and transformation of resins and exudates from plants. Comparative studies on propolis collected from a wide range of countries are crucial for linking its provenance to antibacterial activity and thus ensuring that the beneficial properties of propolis are used more efficiently by the general public. This study reports the in vitro screening of ethanol extracts of propolis (n = 40), collected from a wide range of countries within the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones, and on the comparison of their activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using a broth microdilution assay. The results obtained revealed that propolis extracts were mostly active against Gram-positive bacteria. The samples were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to model their activity against Gram-positive microorganisms. Three distinct clusters were distinguished in the PCA mapping based on MIC values, categorizing samples with strong (MIC range 3.9-31.25 mg/L), moderate (MIC range 31.25-≥500 mg/L) and weak antibacterial activity or inactivity (MIC ≥ 500 mg/L only). It is hypothesized that for samples of tropical provenance differences in the activity profiles may depend on the climatic characteristics of the collection sites. High antibacterial activity was observed for samples from locations characterized by a wet-tropical rainforest-type climate. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The constant chemical composition of T. angustula propolis is explained by the collection of resins preferentially from Schinus terebenthifolius, a plant source found throughout Brazil.

abstract={Resin is an important building material in the nests of honeybees, but little is known about how it is handled within the nest and how its collection is controlled. We studied the functional organization of resin work to better understand how a colony adaptively controls its intake of resin. Two hypotheses have been proposed for how resin collectors stay informed of the need for additional resin: (1) the unloading difficulty hypothesis (resin need is sensed indirectly by the unloading delay) and (2) the caulking activity hypothesis (resin need is sensed directly while engaged in using resin). A falsifiable prediction of the latter hypothesis, but not of the former, is that resin collectors not only gather resin outside the hive but also regularly handle resin inside the hive (taking it from other bees and using it to caulk crevices). Consistent with this prediction are our findings that in the resin sector of a colony's economy, unlike in the pollen, nectar, and water sectors, there is no strict division of labor between the collectors and the users of a material. Over the course of a day, bees seen collecting resin were also commonly seen using resin. Moreover, we found that the unloading locations of resin collectors are unlike those of water and nectar collectors, being deep inside the hive (at the sites of resin use) rather than at the hive entrance. This arrangement facilitates the engagement in resin use by resin collectors. We conclude that the caulking activity hypothesis is well-supported, but that the unloading difficulty hypothesis also remains viable, for we found that resin collectors experience variable delays in getting rid of their loads, from less than 15 min to more than an hour, consistent with this hypothesis. The stage is now set for experimental tests of these two hypotheses. Both may be correct, which if true will imply that social insect workers, despite their small brains, can acquire and integrate information from multiple sources to improve their knowledge of conditions within the colony. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={In the present study, the HPLC method on a C18 column with on-line spectrophotometric and fluorimetric detection was used for separation and determination of dehydroabietic acid and abietic acid in propolis. The samples of propolis tincture were prepared prior to the HPLC analysis. The mobile phase for isocratic elution was methanol-water 87:13 containing 0.05% formic acid. Abietic acid was detected with spectrophotometric detection at 238 nm, and dehydroabietic acid was detected with fluorimetric detection (excitation 225 nm, emission 285 nm). The limits of determination (signal/noise ratio 10) were 100 ng/mL for dehydroabietic acid and 200 ng/mL abietic acid. The calibration graphs were linear over a wide interval from the limit of determination to 1 mg/mL. Analytical recovery and reproducibility exceeded more than 89%. The developed method was used for analysis of propolis from Slovakia. Mass spectrometry was used for identification of the studied acids. The results demonstrated that dehydroabietic acid was present in all tested samples of propolis. Its content was different (3.7 μg/g-44.7 μg/g of propolis) depending on the source of propolis.

abstract={All of the 13+ species of Centris bees that occur in the Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica construct brood cells consisting of local materials cemented together by a waxy-resin. A major question to be determined was whether the soil, sand, or wood chips which form the cell wall of the various species of Centris are cemented together by waxy-resin secretions from female bees, from other sources, or a mixture. The nests of Centris flavofasciata generally consist of a single provisioned cell at the end of a short (6-10 cm) tunnel excavated in sand. The nesting behavior is described and can be divided into four major steps once a site is selected by a female. The four major steps are: 1) tunnel construction, 2) cell construction, 3) cell provisioning, and 4) nest completion. These steps are further subdivided and provided a method to investigate the possible source of the waxy-resin.},

Thus far, DNA from four insect and one plant species has been extracted from amber fossils. In the case of the stingless bee in Dominican amber, evidence of reproducibility is provided, since two independent laboratories isolated DNA from six or more different specimens of the same insect. Amber sources for DNA studies are listed together with their advantages and disadvantages. The important points are the availability of desired pieces, the proper identification of the fossil, verification of the amber deposit, the cost involved, and the feasibility of causing damage to the specimen. The availability of several types of amber (Mexican, Dominican, Baltic, Chinese, Canadian, Siberian and Lebanese) at four major sources (academic collections, commercial dealers, private collections and amber mines) is discussed.

abstract={The phenolic compounds present in 38 propolis samples produced in tropical Venezuela by imported Apis mellifera and five indigenous species of stingless bees, and seven propolis samples from different temperate regions were analysed by HPLC. The different tropical propolis generally showed a single phenolic profile characterized by the occurrence of polyprenylated benzophenones as major components. Flavonoids were present in only a few samples, and in each case they were found to be lipophilic methylated 6-oxygenated flavones (eupatorin, hispidulin, 5-hydroxy-6,7,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, etc.). Generally, no correlations between the composition of tropical propolis and the place of collection or the bee species were found. However, propolis from temperate areas contained flavonoids (with an unsubstituted ring B) as the main phenolic components (pinobanksin, pinobanksin 3-acetate, pinocembrin, chrysin, galangin and tectochrysin). These analyses confirmed that the source of the phenolics found in propolis produced in temperate regions was different Populus species of section Aigeiros (Salicaceae). The resins exuded by the flowers of Clusia minor and C. major (Guttiferae) contained the polyprenylated benzophenones found in the majority of the propolis studied, suggesting that this is the main source for propolis in tropical Venezuela. © 1993.},

abstract={The foraging behavior of three stingless bees, Trigona (Tetragonula) minangkabau, T. (Trigonella) moorei and T. (Heterotrigona) itama, was studied to describe patterns of resource harvest in disturbed forest areas in Sumatra, Indonesia. 1. Average daily total number of foraging flights per colony was 1200 in T. minangkabau, 2400 in T. moorei and 7000 in T. itama and it was proportional to colony population size. Foragers collecting nectar, pollen or plant resin were respectively 70-80%, 10-20% and <10% in the three species. Pollen was collected most in the morning. Nectar collection peaked in midday in T. itama but continued almost evenly until dusk in T. minangkabau and T. moorei. Resin was collected evenly throughout day. 2. In all the three species the volume of a nectar load carried by a returning forager did not decrease until 1600, followed by slight decline. In the morning the sugar concentration of nectar was almost constantly 30%, and in the afternoon its maximum value reached 60% although some remained 30%. As a result, the mean sugar weight in a nectar load gradually increased until dusk. 3. In T. minangkabau, resin was collected by specialized foragers. Nectar foragers switched to collect pollen and vice versa. There were two types of foraging: "exploitatory" flights, the repitition of short, rather constant flights bringing back full resource loads, and "exploratory" flights, prolonged flight and/or reduction in amount of resources carried. Exploitatory flights followed the exploratory flights which led to discovery of rich sources. Mean duration of exploitatory flights was 7 min during nectar collection, 12 min for pollen and 23 min for resin. Sites of exploited flowers were estimated to be 84-434 m distant from the nest site. Mean duration of flights for nectar collection was 13 min in the morning and 6 min in the late afternoon. © 1985 Society of Population Ecology.},
